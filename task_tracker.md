# Task Tracker

## Open Tasks
- [ ] Black Owned account: SP-API production access still suppressed after verification + LWA rotation; escalate SPS manual unsuppress request with app IDs — reported 2026-02-12 by Marco
- [ ] Liquidation workflow: integrate newly submitted SKU batch (Black Owned + Kinfolk + Card Plug), verify send-to-liquidation status, and run recheck in 2 days — updated 2026-02-12 (SKU list received + reconfirmed)
- [ ] Standardize all report outputs to match the #tasks board format Marco referenced (“I thought all the reports would look like this”) and apply the template across active report channels — added 2026-02-13 by Marco

## Preferences / Operating Rules
- Pinning in #tasks is disabled per Marco (set 2026-02-12). Do not pin/unpin task board messages unless Marco explicitly re-enables it.
