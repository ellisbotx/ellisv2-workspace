# MISSION 1: REVENUE AUTOPSY

## Portfolio Overview (Trailing 12 Months)

| Brand | Revenue | Net Profit | Margin | Ad Spend | ACOS | SKUs (Active/Total) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Black Owned | $407,403 | $108,776 | 26.7% | $69,993 | 17.2% | 31/49 |
| Card Plug | $299,317 | $119,792 | 40.0% | $10,805 | 3.6% | ~20 |
| Kinfolk | $275,382 | $80,024 | 29.1% | $46,347 | 16.8% | 25/45 |
| **TOTAL** | **$982,102** | **$308,592** | **31.4%** | **$127,145** | **12.9%** | |

## 1. Month-over-Month Revenue Trends

### Black Owned
| Month | Revenue | MoM Change |
|---|---|---|
| Feb 2025 | $50,904 | — |
| Mar 2025 | $35,471 | -30.3% |
| Apr 2025 | $29,707 | -16.3% |
| May 2025 | $26,087 | -12.2% |
| Jun 2025 | $27,057 | +3.7% |
| Jul 2025 | $25,355 | -6.3% |
| Aug 2025 | $23,392 | -7.7% |
| Sep 2025 | $19,915 | -14.9% |
| Oct 2025 | $26,842 | +34.8% |
| Nov 2025 | $53,997 | +101.2% |
| Dec 2025 | $63,925 | +18.4% |
| Jan 2026 | $17,900 | -72.0% |
| Feb 1-10 | $6,850 | (partial) |

**Diagnosis:** Black Owned had a BRUTAL decline from Feb→Sep 2025 (dropped 61%). Revenue bottomed at $19.9K in Sep before Q4 seasonal lift. Post-holiday crash to $17.9K in Jan is alarming — that's the LOWEST non-partial month.

### Card Plug
| Month | Revenue | MoM Change |
|---|---|---|
| Feb 2025 | $13,070 | — |
| Mar 2025 | $12,723 | -2.7% |
| Apr 2025 | $9,951 | -21.8% |
| May 2025 | $13,926 | +39.9% |
| Jun 2025 | $18,484 | +32.7% |
| Jul 2025 | $18,720 | +1.3% |
| Aug 2025 | $17,587 | -6.1% |
| Sep 2025 | $12,902 | -26.6% |
| Oct 2025 | $23,029 | +78.5% |
| Nov 2025 | $56,343 | +144.6% |
| Dec 2025 | $75,806 | +34.5% |
| Jan 2026 | $19,578 | -74.2% |
| Feb 1-10 | $7,197 | (partial) |

**Diagnosis:** Card Plug is the HEALTHIEST brand. Actually grew through summer. Apr was the only real dip. Strong Q4 performance. Jan 2026 ($19.6K) is higher than most non-Q4 months. This brand is holding steady.

### Kinfolk
| Month | Revenue | MoM Change |
|---|---|---|
| Feb 2025 | $22,174 | — |
| Mar 2025 | $17,332 | -21.8% |
| Apr 2025 | $15,060 | -13.1% |
| May 2025 | $15,062 | 0.0% |
| Jun 2025 | $20,792 | +38.0% |
| Jul 2025 | $17,872 | -14.0% |
| Aug 2025 | $15,233 | -14.8% |
| Sep 2025 | $11,970 | -21.4% |
| Oct 2025 | $14,713 | +22.9% |
| Nov 2025 | $41,214 | +180.2% |
| Dec 2025 | $62,876 | +52.6% |
| Jan 2026 | $15,231 | -75.8% |
| Feb 1-10 | $5,854 | (partial) |

**Diagnosis:** Kinfolk follows the same pattern as Black Owned — decline Feb→Sep, Q4 spike, post-holiday crash. Sep was the floor ($11.97K). Jan 2026 is back to the mid-pack $15K level.

## 2. Seasonality Patterns

- **Q4 Dominance:** Nov+Dec = ~$350K combined across brands (36% of annual revenue in 2 months). The business is a holiday gift business.
- **Feb Bump:** All 3 brands show stronger Feb vs surrounding months. Valentine's Day / Black History Month effect.
- **Summer Trough:** Jun-Sep is consistently the weakest period. Sep is the absolute bottom.
- **Oct Ramp:** Revenue starts climbing in Oct as holiday shopping begins.
- **The Ugly Truth:** Outside Q4+Feb, monthly run rate is ~$55-65K across all 3 brands. That's $660-780K annualized. You NEED Q4 to hit $1M.

## 3. Brand Decline Rankings

**Fastest Declining: Black Owned**
- Feb 2025: $50.9K → Jan 2026: $17.9K (non-Q4 comparison = -65%)
- Bleeding sessions: 36.6K → 15.4K
- Highest ad spend ($70K/yr) with shrinking returns

**Holding Steady: Card Plug**
- Feb 2025: $13.1K → Jan 2026: $19.6K (+50% actually)
- Lowest ad dependency, highest margins
- Only brand that GREW year-over-year outside Q4

**Middle: Kinfolk**
- Feb 2025: $22.2K → Jan 2026: $15.2K (-31%)
- 20 dead SKUs dragging down the catalog
- Too many SKUs launched that went nowhere

## 4. Ad Spend Efficiency

| Brand | Ad Spend (12mo) | Revenue | ACOS | Profit per $1 Ad | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Black Owned | $69,993 | $407,403 | 17.2% | $1.55 | **OVERSPENDING** |
| Kinfolk | $46,347 | $275,382 | 16.8% | $1.73 | **Moderate waste** |
| Card Plug | $10,805 | $299,317 | 3.6% | $11.09 | **EFFICIENT** |

**Key Finding:** Black Owned spends **6.5x more on ads** than Card Plug but generates only **36% more revenue**. Card Plug proves you can drive nearly the same revenue organically. Black Owned is buying revenue at terrible rates.

**Black Owned Jul 2025:** ACOS hit 26.1% ($6.6K ads on $25.4K sales) — that month they spent $6.6K to make $4.8K profit. The ads ate 137% of profit.

**Recommendation:** Cut Black Owned ad spend by 40%. If revenue drops less than 40%, you were wasting money. Card Plug's model is the template.

## 5. The January Refund Spike

| Brand | Jan 2026 Refund % | Jan Refund Cost | Normal Refund % |
|---|---|---|---|
| Black Owned | 15.14% (111 units) | $2,117 | 5.15% avg |
| Card Plug | 16.52% (164 units) | $2,619 | ~5% avg |
| Kinfolk | 16.62% (122 units) | $2,001 | 5.51% avg |

**Total Jan refund cost: $6,737** — that's revenue straight out the window.

**Diagnosis:** This is classic **post-holiday gift returns**. People receive games as Christmas gifts, open them, decide "not for me," return in January. The 3x spike is consistent across all brands = systemic, not product-specific.

**This is unavoidable in the gift category.** The only mitigation:
1. Ensure packaging/unboxing experience is premium (reduces "not what I expected" returns)
2. Include "party starter" inserts that make people want to PLAY immediately
3. Accept it as cost of doing business in the gifting vertical

## 6. Session/Traffic Analysis

### Black Owned Sessions
- Feb 2025: 36,640
- Sep 2025: 18,272 (trough)
- Nov 2025: 36,570
- Jan 2026: 15,378
- Conversion: 5.65% avg

### Kinfolk Sessions
- Feb 2025: 21,048
- Sep 2025: 11,298 (trough)
- Oct 2025: 36,468 (anomaly — huge traffic, 2.06% conv)
- Jan 2026: 15,762
- Conversion: 5.31% avg

**Diagnosis:** It's BOTH a demand problem AND a conversion problem.
- Traffic is declining year-over-year (Black Owned: 36.6K → 15.4K Feb-to-Jan)
- Conversion is inconsistent (Kinfolk Oct: 36K sessions but only 2.06% conversion = traffic quality issue, possibly bad ad targeting)
- Card Plug maintains higher conversion despite lower sessions = better product-market fit

## 7. ROOT CAUSE DIAGNOSIS: Why Revenue Is Declining

### The Core Problem: Black Owned is Deflating

Black Owned was the $50K/mo brand. Now it's a $20K/mo brand (outside Q4). That single brand accounts for **most of the portfolio decline**. The business didn't uniformly shrink — Black Owned collapsed while Card Plug quietly grew.

### Contributing Factors:

1. **Ad Spend Inefficiency (Black Owned):** $70K/yr in ads generating diminishing returns. ACOS worsened from ~17% to 26% in summer. Money is being burned on keywords that don't convert.

2. **Catalog Bloat:** 49 SKUs at Black Owned, 45 at Kinfolk. Most aren't selling. Dead SKUs dilute listing quality signals, waste storage fees, and spread ad spend too thin.

3. **Traffic Loss:** Sessions dropped 50%+ at Black Owned Feb→Jan. This suggests either:
   - Amazon algorithm deprioritization (too many low-BSR listings)
   - Competitor gains in the niche
   - Reduced ad visibility despite maintained spend

4. **No New Winners:** The last clear hit was Hood Charades (2022-era). No new product has broken through to replace declining performers. The portfolio is aging without refresh.

5. **Market Saturation:** The Black party games niche on Amazon is more crowded now. Original first-mover advantage has eroded.

6. **Seasonal Dependency:** 36% of annual revenue in Nov+Dec is dangerous. Any Q4 disruption (stockouts, algorithm changes, competition) is existential.

### The Honest Summary:
The business went from ~$110K/mo (Q4 2024 pace) to ~$60K/mo (mid-2025) because Black Owned's organic flywheel broke. Ad spend couldn't compensate. Card Plug is the only brand executing well. Kinfolk has too many SKUs and not enough winners.

## 🟢 WINNERS — Top 10 SKUs by Profit (Feb 1-10)

| Rank | Brand | Product | Units | Sales | Profit | Margin | Trajectory |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | BO | Hood Charades | 70 | $1,743 | $591 | 34% | ⬇️ Still #1 but declining. Was the $10K/mo SKU. |
| 2 | BO | Baddie Drinking Cards | 39 | $950 | $578 | 61% | ✅ ZERO ad spend, pure organic. Star performer. |
| 3 | KF | Who Said Dat | 72 | $1,511 | $512 | 34% | ✅ Kinfolk's best. Ads eating margin though. |
| 4 | BO | Black Love Couple Games | 26 | $650 | $334 | 51% | ✅ Steady niche performer. Low ad spend. |
| 5 | KF | Who Said Dat R&B | 26 | $494 | $279 | 57% | ✅ Extension of WSD franchise. No ads needed. |
| 6 | KF | Hood Hints V2 | 19 | $397 | $240 | 60% | ✅ Zero ads, great margin. |
| 7 | KF | Hood Hints (Charades) | 57 | $1,196 | $233 | 19% | ⚠️ High volume but ads destroying margin. |
| 8 | BO | Damn Gina Drinking | 13 | $325 | $183 | 56% | ✅ Zero ads, nostalgia sells. |
| 9 | KF | Sistas Ladies Night | 14 | $294 | $150 | 51% | ✅ Solid niche. |
| 10 | BO | Jerome In The House | 13 | $325 | $143 | 44% | ✅ Companion to Damn Gina. |

**Notable:** Card Plug's SKU-level data isn't broken out in the P&L extract, but the brand-level Feb 1-10 shows $7,197 revenue / $2,927 profit at **40.7% margin** with only $68 in ads. Card Plug as a BRAND is a top performer.

## 📊 PORTFOLIO REBALANCE

### Current State
| Brand | Total SKUs | Active (selling) | Dead (0 sales) | Watch | Kill |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Black Owned | ~49 | 31 | 18 | 14 | 18 |
| Kinfolk | ~45 | 25 | 20 | 9 | 20 |
| Card Plug | ~20 | ~20 | ~0 | — | — |
| **TOTAL** | **~114** | **76** | **38** | **23** | **38** |

### Recommended Catalog Size
| Brand | Current | Target | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Black Owned | 49 | 15-18 | Kill 18 dead + 10-15 from watch list failures |
| Kinfolk | 45 | 12-15 | Kill 20 dead + watch list failures |
| Card Plug | 20 | 20 | No changes — this brand is right-sized |
| **TOTAL** | **114** | **47-53** | **Cut catalog by 50-60%** |

### The Logic:
- **Card Plug runs ~20 SKUs and has the best margins in the portfolio.** That's the template.
- Every dead SKU = storage fees + catalog dilution + management overhead
- Amazon's algorithm rewards sellers with high-velocity listings, not wide catalogs
- Better to have 15 SKUs doing 10+ units/day each than 45 SKUs doing 1-2 units/day

### Ideal SKU Profile (Keep If):
- Sells 10+ units per month consistently
- Margin above 25% after ads
- BSR under 500K
- FBA stock lasts 2-4 months (not 12+ months)
- Doesn't require ad spend to maintain sales

## 💰 FINANCIAL IMPACT OF SKU MASSACRE

| Action | Savings/Recovery |
|---|---|
| Kill 38 SKUs — stop storage fees | ~$200-400/mo in avoided long-term storage |
| Liquidate trapped inventory ($14,766 COGS) | Recover $5-10K via liquidation (30-70% of COGS) |
| Reduce ad spend on dying SKUs | $2-3K/mo freed up |
| Focus ad budget on winners only | Improved ROAS across portfolio |
| **Net annual impact** | **$30-50K in saved costs + improved margins** |

---

## 🎯 TOP 5 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **File liquidation/removal orders for all 38 Kill List SKUs THIS WEEK.** Every day they sit = more storage fees.

2. **Cut Black Owned ad spend by 40%.** Redistribute 50% of the savings to Card Plug and Kinfolk's proven winners. Pocket the rest.

3. **Set calendar reminder for March 10:** Review all 23 Watch List SKUs. Anything below target = immediate kill.

4. **Audit Hood Hints (Kinfolk) ad spend.** $364 in ads for $233 profit in 10 days = you're paying $364 to make $233. That's backwards. Cut ads, see if organic holds.

5. **Double down on Card Plug.** It's the most efficient brand. Consider launching 2-3 new Card Plug SKUs using the same playbook (low-ad, organic-first, high-margin).
