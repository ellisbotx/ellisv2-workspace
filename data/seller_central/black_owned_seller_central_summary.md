### 🚨 Hood Charades OG Return Crisis
40 returns in 30 days = **15.5% refund rate** (32 refunded / 206 ordered per business report)

**Customer complaint patterns:**
- "Cards are the same as Hood Charades 2" — DUPLICATE CONTENT between V1 & V2
- "No instructions, QR code goes to giveaway" — packaging issue
- "Can't act these out" — game mechanics confusion
- "Not what I expected" / "Too basic" — listing mismatch
- "Very confusing" / "Unclear directions"

**Root causes:**
1. V1 and V2 have identical/overlapping cards → customers buying both feel ripped off
2. Instructions missing or inadequate
3. Listing images/description may oversell what the game actually is
