## 3. 🟡 ON MARCO'S LIST BUT NOT KILLED IN MISSION 3 (Still Selling) — ~22 SKUs

These are on Marco's liquidation list but Mission 3 data shows they're still generating revenue. Marco may want to reconsider OR has already made the call.

### Actively Selling — Strongest Reconsider Candidates
- **Bad and Boujee** (BO) — 5 units/10d, 56% margin, $209/mo profit. Hits $200 threshold.
- **Stay Woke** (KF) — 7 units/10d, 54% margin, $258/mo profit. Only 4 units left — will sell out. **Consider restocking.**
- **Girlll** (BO) — 11 units/10d, 47% margin, $354/mo profit. BUT 3,581 units overstocked. **Don't kill listing — liquidate ~3,400 excess units, keep ~200.**
- **Grown Folks** (BO) — 11 units/10d, 24% margin, $197/mo. Thin margin but selling. 139 units = 4 months.

### Slow Sellers — Marco's Call Already Made
- Nightcap (KF) — 3/10d, 58% margin, 72 units. Profitable trickle.
- BFFs (KF) — 2/10d, 56% margin, 73 units.
- Stopwatch (KF) — 2/10d, 54% margin, 71 units.
- Soul Music (KF) — 1/10d, 58% margin, 60 units. Too slow.
- Faded (KF) — 1/10d, 84 units. Kill confirmed.
- VS (KF) — 1/10d, 2 units. Natural exit.

### Card Plug Items (likely already 0 FBA stock)
- Sippin, Dont Snitch, Hood Riddles, Where is The Lie — verify FBA stock before filing removal orders

### Already at 0 Stock (No Action Needed)
- Charades and Chill (BO) — 0 units
- LIT (BO) — 0 units
- The South (BO) — 0 units
- Street Smart (KF) — 0 units
- Chill (KF) — 0 units
