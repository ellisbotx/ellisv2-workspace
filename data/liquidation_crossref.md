## 2. ⚠️ ON MARCO'S LIST BUT NOT MY KILL LIST (34 SKUs)

### 2A. Marco's items that are on MY WATCH LIST (12 SKUs)
Marco already made the call — these resolve the watch list. No need to wait 30 days.

**Black Owned Watch → Marco Says Kill:**
| SKU | Feb 1-10 Units | FBA Stock | My 30-Day Target | Pace | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Girlll 2 | 3 | 370 | 12 | 9/mo | 370 units at 9/mo = 41 months stock. **MARCO IS RIGHT — KILL** |
| God Is Dope | 2 | 700 | 10 | 6/mo | 700 units at 6/mo = **117 months**. KILL |
| Spill The Tea | 4 | 541 | 15 | 12/mo | 541 units at 12/mo = 45 months. KILL |
| Bad and Boujee | 5 | 183 | 15 | 15/mo | Borderline — hitting target at 56% margin. **⚠️ RECONSIDER** |
| Hot Girl | 1 | 243 | 5 | 3/mo | 243 units at 3/mo = 81 months. KILL |
| Music Head | 2 | 41 | 8 | 6/mo | Only 41 units, 6% margin w/ ads. Kill is fine. |

**Kinfolk Watch → Marco Says Kill:**
| SKU | Feb 1-10 Units | FBA Stock | Pace | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nightcap | 3 | 72 | 9/mo | 58% margin, 8 months stock. **⚠️ RECONSIDER** |
| BFFs | 2 | 73 | 6/mo | 56% margin. **⚠️ RECONSIDER** |
| Stopwatch | 2 | 71 | 6/mo | 54% margin. Borderline. |
| Faded | 1 | 84 | 3/mo | 84 units at 3/mo = 28 months. Kill is fine. |
| Soul Music | 1 | 60 | 3/mo | 58% margin but 20 months stock. Kill is fine. |
| VS | 1 | 2 | 3/mo | Only 2 units left — natural exit, no action needed. |

### 2B. Marco's items NOT on kill OR watch (need review) (11 SKUs)

**Black Owned — ACTUALLY SELLING (Marco might want to reconsider):**
| SKU | Feb 1-10 Units | Sales | Margin | FBA Stock | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Girlll** | **11** | **$250** | **47%** | **3,581** | ⚠️ **SELLING WELL — 11 units in 10 days, 47% margin. BUT 3,581 units = 108 months of stock. The PRODUCT is fine, the INVENTORY is the problem.** |
| **Grown Folks** | **11** | **$275** | **24%** | **139** | ⚠️ **SELLING — 11 units in 10 days. Margin is thin (24%) due to ads. Stock is manageable (4 months). Reconsider.** |

**Black Owned — Already at 0 stock (liquidation already done or N/A):**
| SKU | FBA Stock | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Charades and Chill | 0 | Already gone. No action needed. |
| LIT | 0 | Already gone. |
| The South | 0 | Already gone. |
| Street Kings | ? | ASIN B0F4YFM8DG — not appearing in Sellerboard Feb data at all. May be new/unlisted. |

**Kinfolk — Zero sales, Marco missed by my analysis too:**
| SKU | FBA Stock | Feb 1-10 Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| King & Queen | 71 | 0 | Dead. Should've been on my kill list. ✓ Marco correct. |
| Hood Genius | 73 | 0 | Dead. Should've been on my kill list. ✓ Marco correct. |
| Family Goals | 20 | 0 | Dead. Low stock (20 units), low priority but still dead. |
| Slang | 54 | 0 | Dead. $9.99 price, $2.36 COGS = terrible unit economics. ✓ Marco correct. |

**Kinfolk — ACTUALLY SELLING (Marco might want to reconsider):**
| SKU | Feb 1-10 Units | Sales | Margin | FBA Stock | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Stay Woke** | **7** | **$161** | **54%** | **4** | ⚠️ **7 SALES IN 10 DAYS at 54% margin! Only 4 units left though — will sell out naturally. But this product has demand. Don't kill the listing — consider reordering.** |

### Card Plug (11 SKUs) — Special Case
Card Plug SKU-level data isn't broken out in the P&L extract. The brand overall is healthy ($7,197 sales / $2,927 profit in Feb 1-10 at 40.7% margin with only $68 ads).

Marco's Card Plug liquidation items: Sippin, Dont Snitch, Code Switching, No No Words, Akeem, Hood Riddles, Shot Luck, Where is The Lie, Shot Shot Shot, Shot Caller, Momma Said No

**Assessment:** Card Plug likely has 0 FBA stock for many of these (brand-level data shows very efficient inventory). Marco may be cleaning up MFN listings or AWD remnants. These weren't flagged in Mission 2 because Card Plug as a brand wasn't showing dead SKU problems — it's the most efficient brand in the portfolio.

## 3. 🔴 ON MY KILL LIST BUT NOT MARCO'S (8 SKUs)

These are SKUs I flagged as kills that Marco should consider adding.

### Black Owned (5 SKUs)
| SKU | ASIN | FBA Stock | Units | Why Kill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AA Puzzle (Group Hug) | B0BV38YRNP | 143 | 0 | Zero sales, no BSR, puzzles don't fit brand. $335 trapped. |
| Hood Exit Card Game | B0DZY2GH63 | 136 | 0 | Zero sales, no BSR, new launch FAILED. $318 trapped. |
| Hi Ms Parker | B09XN1PCS6 | 83 | 0 | Zero sales, BSR 1.8M. $194 trapped. |
| Divulge Couples | B0B6QDMBQ4 | 56 | 0 | Zero sales, no BSR. $131 trapped. |
| AA Puzzle (Tulips) | B0BWNKBGJ7 | 6 | 0 | Zero sales, 6 units, minimal. |

### Kinfolk (3 SKUs)
| SKU | ASIN | FBA Stock | Units | Why Kill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Who Made Potato Salad | B0F225284V | 396 | 0 | Zero sales, 396 units. $396 trapped. |
| Divas Night Out | B0CPL68HYG | 201 | 0 | Zero sales, 201 units. $310 trapped. |
| Family Tree | B0F677914S | 147 | 0 | Zero sales, 147 units. $147 trapped. |

**Note:** Juneteenth Trivia (B0CPKVD2DP, 190 units, 1 sale) is also on my kill list but not Marco's. It's seasonal (June only) — could argue for keeping it dormant until May. Marco's call.

**Total trapped inventory in these 8 missed SKUs: ~$1,831**

## 4. 🟡 WATCH LIST CONFLICTS RESOLVED

12 SKUs were on my 30-day watch list that Marco has already decided to kill. This simplifies things:

| SKU | Brand | My Watch Target | Marco's Call | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Girlll 2 | BO | 12 units/30d | Kill | ✅ Kill — overstocked |
| God Is Dope | BO | 10 units/30d | Kill | ✅ Kill — massively overstocked |
| Spill The Tea | BO | 15 units/30d | Kill | ✅ Kill — overstocked |
| Bad and Boujee | BO | 15 units/30d | Kill | ⚠️ Hitting target, 56% margin — reconsider? |
| Hot Girl | BO | 5 units/30d | Kill | ✅ Kill — overstocked |
| Music Head | BO | 8 units/30d | Kill | ✅ Kill — bad margin |
| Nightcap | KF | 10 units/30d | Kill | ⚠️ 58% margin, manageable stock — reconsider? |
| BFFs | KF | 8 units/30d | Kill | ⚠️ 56% margin — reconsider? |
| Stopwatch | KF | 8 units/30d | Kill | Borderline. Marco's call. |
| Faded | KF | 5 units/30d | Kill | ✅ Kill — too slow |
| Soul Music | KF | 5 units/30d | Kill | ✅ Kill — too slow |
| VS | KF | 5 units/30d | Kill | ✅ Natural exit (2 units left) |

## 5. 🚨 SPECIAL NOTES

### Kinfolk SKUs Still Trickling (Marco May Be Liquidating Active Sellers)
| SKU | Feb 1-10 Units | Margin | FBA Stock | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Stay Woke** | **7** | **54%** | **4** | 🔥 Selling great! Will sell out on its own. Don't kill listing — consider restock. |
| Nightcap | 3 | 58% | 72 | Profitable trickle. 8 months stock. |
| BFFs | 2 | 56% | 73 | Profitable trickle. 12 months stock. |
| Stopwatch | 2 | 54% | 71 | Profitable trickle. 12 months stock. |
| VS | 1 | 50% | 2 | Will sell out naturally. |
| Soul Music | 1 | 58% | 60 | Profitable but very slow. |

### Black Owned SKUs Still Selling That Marco Wants to Kill
| SKU | Feb 1-10 Units | Margin | FBA Stock | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Girlll** | **11** | **47%** | **3,581** | 🔥 Product is alive! But 3,581 units = catastrophic overstock. Liquidate excess, keep ~200 units. |
| **Grown Folks** | **11** | **24%** | **139** | Selling but thin margin. 4 months stock = manageable. |
| **Bad and Boujee** | **5** | **56%** | **183** | Hitting pace target with great margin. **Strongest reconsider candidate.** |

### Card Plug Status
- Brand is healthy overall (40%+ margins, minimal ads)
- Most liquidation SKUs likely already at 0 FBA stock or MFN-only
- No SKU-level concerns flagged in Mission 2 analysis
- Marco probably cleaning up listings, not active inventory

## 6. 📋 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Confirmed Kills (no debate): 30 overlap + 4 Kinfolk zero-sellers Marco caught that I missed = **34 SKUs**

### Add to Kill List (Marco missed): **8 SKUs** — Puzzles, Hood Exit, Hi Ms Parker, Divulge, Tulips, Potato Salad, Divas Night Out, Family Tree

### Reconsider Before Killing (3 SKUs):
1. **Bad and Boujee** — 5 units/10d, 56% margin, hitting watch target. Why kill a profitable SKU?
2. **Nightcap** — 3 units/10d, 58% margin. Manageable stock.
3. **BFFs** — 2 units/10d, 56% margin. Manageable stock.

### Special Handling:
- **Girlll** — Don't kill the listing. Liquidate ~3,400 of 3,581 units, keep ~200. Product sells.
- **Stay Woke** — 7 sales in 10 days at 54% margin with only 4 units left. This should be a RESTOCK, not a kill.
- **Grown Folks** — 11 units/10d but 24% margin. Stock is manageable (139 units = 4 months). Could survive with ad cuts.

### Card Plug: Verify FBA stock before filing removal orders. Many may already be resolved.
