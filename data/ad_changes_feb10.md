## KINFOLK — All Ads Paused

| Campaign | Previous ROAS (30d) | Action | Watch For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sunday's Best | 1.33 (lifetime) | Paused | Already dead, confirm no impact |
| Hood Hints OG | 1.77 | Paused | Check OG + V2 combined sales |
| Who Said Dat OG | 2.94 | Paused | Check OG + variation combined sales |
| SayLess OG | 2.34 | Paused | Check OG + SayLess 2 combined (OG does $6.4K/mo organic, ads drove only 12/300+ sales) |
| Hood To Hollywood | 3.52 | Paused | Was profitable — if organic drops, consider restarting |

## BLACK OWNED — Changes Made

| Campaign | Previous ROAS (30d) | Action | Watch For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hood Charades (Performance) | 2.18 | Budget $500→$200/day | Check all 7 variations combined. Did lower budget maintain sales? |
| Prayer Warrior (Performance) | 1.89 | **KILL** | Confirm paused. Check organic holds. |
| Prayer Warrior (Product Target) | 3.27 | **KEEP** | Monitor — was slightly profitable |
| Ghetto Pass (Performance) | 2.60 | **KILL** | Confirm paused. Had $62.85/mo storage surcharge too. |
| Black Love (Performance) | 1.13 | **KILL** | Confirm paused. 22 sales in 3mo, terrible. |
| Jerome In The House | 2.75 | **KEEP** | Leave alone — only $28/mo loss, 1 variation, halo worth it |

## Key Metrics to Pull on Feb 24

For each product above:
1. Total sales (organic + ad) for 30 days BEFORE changes (Jan 10 – Feb 10)
2. Total sales for 14 days AFTER changes (Feb 10 – Feb 24)
3. Compare: Did organic hold? Did variations drop?
4. Any ranking changes visible?

## Monthly Savings (Estimated)
- Kinfolk ads killed: ~$3,800/mo
- BO Prayer Warrior Performance killed: ~$639/mo
- BO Ghetto Pass killed: ~$1,270/mo
- BO Black Love killed: ~$475/mo
- BO Hood Charades budget cut: ~$3,000/mo saved (from ~$9K to ~$6K)
- **Total estimated savings: ~$9,184/mo**

## Decision Framework for Feb 24 Review
- If organic sales hold within 70% → ads weren't needed, keep off
- If organic drops >30% on a SKU → consider restarting at lower bid/budget
- If variation sales drop → halo effect was real, reconsider
