## The Business

**Marco's Card Game Portfolio:**
- 3 brands: Black Owned, Card Plug, Kinfolk
- ~160 SKUs, 20-30 meaningful revenue drivers
- Primary channel: Amazon FBA (3 separate Seller Central accounts)
- Goal: Scalable catalog, automated ops, multi-million trajectory without Marco as bottleneck

**Tool Stack:**
- Seller Central (truth) → Sellerboard (profit) → Helium 10 (SEO) → Jungle Scout (demand)
- Google Sheets/Excel for tracking (manual, fragmented)
- No live API pipeline yet

**Healthy SKU Criteria:**
- $200+/month profit minimum
- ACOS under control
- 4.0+ review rating
- No "not what I expected" patterns
- Inventory turns without panic

**Kill SKU Rule:**
- Under $200/month profit consistently
- No clear fix path (listing/images/pricing)
- OR ad spend unscalable
- OR excessive returns
- OR storage liability

## Working With Marco

- Prefers direct, action-oriented help
- Wants me to ask questions relentlessly (until he says "stop")
- Take initiative — don't wait for perfect instructions
- Judgment is currently gut-based; help codify into rules

## Lessons & Notes

**Communication Setup (Jan 31, 2026):**
- Single main Telegram DM for all conversation
- Spawn sub-agents for heavy/long-running work (reports, analysis, research)
- Keep main chat responsive — don't block on complex tasks
- Sub-agents report back when done
