## Working With Marco

- Prefers direct, action-oriented help
- Wants me to ask questions relentlessly (until he says "stop")
- Take initiative — don't wait for perfect instructions
- Judgment is currently gut-based; help codify into rules

**Marco's philosophy (Feb 9, 2026):** "It is your job to earn your team and make yourself more valuable each and every day."

**Auto-fix rule (Feb 9, 2026):** If something we've already agreed upon breaks, FIX IT. Don't check in, don't ask permission, don't wait. Diagnose, fix, verify, and report what happened after. Only escalate if the fix requires something new or outside my access.

**Weekly Soul Review:** Sundays 10 AM CST — I review the week and propose SOUL.md changes. Marco approves before any edits. Added to operating rules: "Evolve the team" — recommend new agents/automations when patterns emerge.

**Wife's Setup:** Ellie runs on separate Discord server with isolated workspace. Marco now understands multi-agent architecture (one engine, many brains).

**Strategic Approach to $5M Goal (Feb 6, 2026):**
- Old method: simple average (total sales ÷ SKU count) × target = SKUs needed
- New method: account for 80/20 rule, model hit rate, strategic portfolio planning
- Philosophy: "Shots on goal" — more SKUs = more chances at winners
- Need to identify current top 20%, project trajectories, calculate new SKUs needed

## Portfolio Financial Snapshot (Feb 10, 2026)

**Trailing 12mo (Feb 2025 – Feb 2026):**
| Brand | Sales | Net Profit | Margin | Ad Spend | ACOS | Active SKUs | Dead SKUs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Black Owned | $407K | $109K | 26.7% | $70K | 17.2% | ~17 | ~18 |
| Card Plug | $299K | $120K | 40.0% | $10.8K | 3.6% | ~21 | ~24 (0 FBA stock) |
| Kinfolk | $275K | $80K | 29.1% | $46K | 16.8% | ~25 | ~20 |
| **TOTAL** | **$982K** | **$309K** | **31.4%** | **$127K** | — | **~63** | **~62** |

**Key Diagnoses (Mission 1 & 2):**
- Black Owned revenue collapsed 65% (Feb '25 $50.9K → Jan '26 $17.9K) — organic traffic died
- Card Plug is the template: best margins (40%), lowest ACOS (3.6%), zero dead inventory w/ FBA stock
- 38 SKUs flagged for kill (trapped inventory ~$14.8K COGS), 23 on 30-day watch (review Mar 10)
- Target: cut portfolio from ~125 → ~50 SKUs
- 36% of revenue comes from Nov+Dec — dangerous Q4 dependency
- Jan refund spike (16%+ all brands) = post-holiday gift returns
- Action items: cut BO ad spend 40%, file removal orders on dead stock, replicate Card Plug model

**Data files:**
- `/workspace/data/sellerboard/black_owned_pnl_12mo.md`
- `/workspace/data/sellerboard/card_plug_pnl_12mo.md`

## Mission 3 Findings — Cash Fortress (Feb 10, 2026)

**SKU Classification (115 active SKUs analyzed):**
- 🟢 27 Stars ($200+/mo profit, healthy margins)
- 🟡 14 Watch ($100-200/mo, declining or high returns)
- 🔴 74 Kill (under $100/mo, no fix path)

**Cash Trapped in Dead/Excess Inventory: $35,197**
- Black Owned: $11,127 (18 zero-sale + 6 low-sellers = 24 kills)
- Card Plug: $18,500 (~25 dead SKUs — CP is NOT as clean as thought, massive AWD dead stock)
- Kinfolk: $5,570 (20 zero-sale + 5 low-sellers = 25 kills)

**Monthly Storage Drain: ~$597/mo ($7,164/yr)**
- BO: ~$252 (aged surcharges) | CP: ~$237 | KF: ~$108

**Critical Problem SKUs:**
- Sunday's Best (KF) — ACOS 109%, losing $312/mo. Kill ads immediately.
- Hood Hints OG (KF) — $1,092/mo ads for $699/mo profit. V2 makes more with $0 ads.
- HoodFued franchise (CP) — 22-31% return rates, 114 returns/30d = 69.5% of all CP returns
- SayLess OG (KF) — 24.7% return rate + $22.60/mo storage surcharge
- Girlll (BO) — 3,581 units = 9 years supply. Liquidate excess, keep listing.

**Top Performers to Double Down:**
- Baddie Drinking (BO) — $1,733/mo, $0 ads, 61% margin
- Soul Trivia (CP) — $1,086/mo, 16.6% conversion, 2% returns
- WSD R&B (KF) — $837/mo, $0 ads, 57% margin
- Hood Hints V2 (KF) — $720/mo, $0 ads, 60% margin
- ORALE Latino (CP) — $376/mo, new market expansion

**Cash Liberation Potential:**
- Liquidate 74 kill SKUs: $10,500-17,600 recovery
- Liquidate excess from selling SKUs: $8,000-13,500
- Stop aged surcharges: $362/mo saved
- Total: $18,500-31,100 one-time + $4,344/yr ongoing

**Kill List Cross-Reference (vs Marco's Feb 4 list of 64):**
- 42 overlap (confirmed), 32 NEW kills Marco needs to add (~$8,254 additional)
- 4 reconsider candidates: Bad and Boujee, Stay Woke, Girlll (partial), Grown Folks
- Total liquidation universe: ~96 unique SKUs
- Reports: `/workspace/data/mission_3_cash_fortress.md`, `/workspace/data/reports/kill_list_crossref_v2.md`

**Portfolio Grade: C+ (projected B+ after cleanup)**

## Ad Strategy Overhaul (Feb 10, 2026)

**Marco's old assumption:** Sales > Spend = good. **Reality:** Need 3.0+ ROAS at ~35-40% margins to break even.

**Kinfolk:** All ads paused. Running organic-only experiment.
**Black Owned:** Killed 3 campaigns (Prayer Warrior Perf, Ghetto Pass, Black Love). Cut Hood Charades budget $500→$200/day (7 variations, too important to kill). Kept Jerome ($28/mo loss, 1 variation) and Prayer Warrior Product Target (3.27 ROAS).
**Estimated savings: ~$9,200/mo**

**Halo Effect Principle:** OG product ads may drive variation sales. Can't kill ads on multi-variation franchises without risking the whole family. Test by monitoring variation sales after pausing OG ads.

**Review date: Feb 24** — compare organic hold across all changes.

## Current Priority

**Etsy → MCF Automation (Card Plug):**
- All credentials collected and stored
- Need to build the actual Python script
- Will replicate for Black Owned and Kinfolk after Card Plug works

**Trifecta Dashboard:**
- Located at `/workspace/trifecta/index.html`
- Auto-updates after each ASIN check
- Shows all 3 brands, suppression status, last check time
- Products page now uses real Sellerboard velocity data (90-day sales)

**Sellerboard Velocity Integration (Completed Feb 2, 2026):**
- All 3 brands exported and CORRECTED: Black Owned ($134.5K revenue, 5,763 units), Card Plug ($151.3K, 7,954 units), Kinfolk ($118.5K, 5,983 units)
- Total: 170 SKUs, 19,700 units sold in 90 days, $404,365 revenue (Nov 4, 2025 → Feb 2, 2026, Amazon.com US only)
- Data source: "Dashboard by product" CSV exports from Sellerboard
- Processing script: `/workspace/scripts/sellerboard_export.py` (fixed to avoid double-counting ad sales and filter by date/marketplace)
- Output: `/workspace/data/sku_velocity.json`
- Reorder tracker and Products dashboard now use real velocity instead of estimates
- Initial error: Reported $897K (3x overcount due to triple-counting ad sales + wrong date range + multiple marketplaces)

## Lessons & Notes

**Script vs LLM Automation (Feb 1, 2026):**
- Marco prefers deterministic scripts over LLM-driven loops
- Scripts don't hallucinate, don't skip items, don't add "Mixed" confusion
- Use LLM for interpretation/reporting, not for iteration logic
- Example: ASIN checker v1 (LLM) checked 7/186 and hallucinated 3. v2 (Python) checked all 166 correctly.

**Communication Setup (Jan 31, 2026 → Feb 4, 2026):**
- Started with Telegram DM, migrated to Discord (Feb 4)
- Discord server with dedicated channels for different topics
- #general for main conversation
- #alerts for urgent notifications (ASIN suppressions, stockouts, critical issues)
- #reports for daily automation summaries (ASIN checks, performance reports)
- #system for meta updates (memory consolidation, new skills, agent evolution)
- Spawn sub-agents for heavy/long-running work (reports, analysis, research)
- Keep main chat responsive — don't block on complex tasks
- Sub-agents report back when done

**LLM Configuration (Feb 2, 2026):**
- Default model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic subscription auth via setup-token)
- OpenAI Codex (gpt-5.2) available but not default
- No fallbacks configured (cleaner error messages)
- Cron jobs updated to use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all scheduled tasks

**Memory System (Feb 2, 2026):**
- MEMORY.md = long-term curated memory (what matters forever)
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md = daily logs (what happened today)
- Semantic search enabled (local embeddings via nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5)
- Weekly consolidation cron (Sun 8 PM) reviews last 7 days, suggests MEMORY.md updates
- Memory manager script: `/workspace/scripts/memory_manager.py` (report, search, consolidate, cleanup)
- Best practices: `/workspace/memory/README.md`
- **Memory updates post to #system channel** for transparency into my learning

**Discord Channel Routing (Feb 4, 2026):**
- All automation results route to dedicated channels
- Configuration: `/workspace/config/discord_channels.json`
- Helper module: `/workspace/scripts/discord_utils.py`
- Documentation: `/workspace/docs/discord_routing.md`
- Daily ASIN check → #reports (summary) + #alerts (if suppressions)
- Memory/skill updates → #system
- Etsy→MCF automation → #orders (when implemented)
- Reorder recommendations → #inventory (when implemented)

**Multi-Agent System (Feb 2, 2026 — updated Feb 8):**
- **Main Agent (Ellis, 💰):** Claude Opus 4.6 — General business operations, daily check-ins, orchestration
- **Code Agent (Codex, 🔧):** OpenAI GPT-5.3 Codex — Technical implementation, scripts, automation, debugging
- **Analysis Agent (Opus, 📊):** Claude Opus 4.6 — Deep analysis, research, number validation, strategic reports
- **Creative Agent (Vibe, 🎨):** Claude Sonnet 4.5 — Product ideation, game concepts, catchy titles, visual/trend analysis
- **Strategic Agent (Atlas, 🧭):** OpenAI o1 — Extended reasoning, long-term planning, portfolio strategy, complex decisions
- All agents share the same workspace (`/Users/ellisbot/.openclaw/workspace`)
- Cross-agent messaging enabled for collaboration
- Main agent coordinates complex tasks across specialized agents
- Marco can message any agent directly (via Discord) or let Main orchestrate

**Agent Cross-Validation Protocol (Feb 4, 2026 - MANDATORY):**
- **All financial analyses MUST be validated by multiple agents before reporting to Marco**
- Independent analysis: Each agent works separately, saves results to own file
- Cross-validation meeting: Agents compare results, resolve discrepancies >5%
- Only validated numbers get reported (or clear explanation if agents can't agree)
- **Marco's standard:** "If the numbers don't match, you haven't finished your work yet"
- Formal protocol: `/workspace/docs/financial_validation_protocol.md`
- Updated AGENTS.md with mandatory validation rules
- Lesson learned (Feb 4): Codex (137 units) vs Opus (10,006 units) - caught data source issue before reporting final numbers

**Scheduled Tasks Protocol (Feb 5, 2026):**
- **SCHEDULED_TASKS.md** tracks all scheduled tasks, completions, and overdue items
- Every heartbeat: review SCHEDULED_TASKS.md for overdue tasks
- If anything overdue: run it immediately or explain why it didn't run
- Log all task completions with timestamp and outcome
- Tasks considered overdue after 2x expected frequency (daily=48h, weekly=14d, hourly=2h)
- Current scheduled tasks:
  - Daily ASIN check (1 AM CST via cron)
  - Weekly memory consolidation (Sun 8 PM CST via cron)
  - Hourly heartbeat proactive checks
- Ensures no tasks slip through the cracks due to cron failures or other issues

**System Reliability Infrastructure (Feb 8, 2026):**
- **Gateway Watchdog** — LaunchAgent, every 60s, auto-restarts gateway if down, notifies #alerts. Zero tokens.
- **Cron Health Monitor** — LaunchAgent, every 6h, checks output file freshness, alerts on 2+ consecutive failures. Zero tokens.
- **Update Checker** — LaunchAgent, Sundays 10 AM, checks npm for new OpenClaw versions, notifies #system. Zero tokens.
- All pure scripts — Marco specifically asked these NOT use AI tokens.
- Lesson: Default to token-free scripts for monitoring. Only use agent turns when AI reasoning is actually needed.

**SOUL.md Rewrite (Feb 9, 2026):**
- Complete rewrite from generic template to Ellis-specific identity
- Marco provided business stances via PDF, merged with my operational rules
- Added: interrupt list, team roster, business defaults (product/pricing/marketing/ops)
- Added: "Evolve the team" operating rule
- Removed: "How I Answer" (Marco didn't want rigid answer formatting)
- Weekly Soul Review cron added: Sundays 10 AM, propose changes, Marco approves
