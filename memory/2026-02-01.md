## Inventory Dashboard (Complete)

Built unified inventory tracking:
- Script: `/workspace/scripts/inventory_tracker.py`
- Dashboard: `/workspace/trifecta/inventory.html`
- Data: `/workspace/data/inventory_dashboard.json`

**Cron:** 3 AM daily silent inventory pull

---

## Reorder Tracker (Complete)

Built velocity-based reorder alerts:
- Script: `/workspace/scripts/reorder_tracker.py`
- Data: `/workspace/data/reorder_report.json`

**Business rules:**
- 75-day lead time
- 90-day safety buffer (runway threshold)
- 500 MOQ per SKU
- 90-day velocity calculation period

**Cron:** Monday & Thursday 7 AM reorder reports

## Sellerboard Integration (In Progress)

**Credentials:**
- URL: https://app.sellerboard.com
- Login: ellisbotx@gmail.com
- Password: In 1Password (`op://Private/Sellerboard/password`)

**Brand mapping (dropdown in top-right):**
- `srgrier45` = Black Owned
- `Card Plug` = Card Plug
- `Kinfolk` = Kinfolk

**To do:** Build browser automation to:
1. Log in nightly at 2 AM
2. Switch brands and export 90-day sales CSVs
3. Process for accurate per-SKU velocity

## ASIN Checker v2 (Complete)

Fixed the ASIN suppression checking system:

**Problem:** LLM-based checker only checked 7/186 ASINs and hallucinated 3 fake ones.

**Solution:** Built pure Python script at `/workspace/scripts/asin_checker.py`:
- No LLM involvement — deterministic, 100% accurate
- Simple Active/Suppressed logic (removed "Mixed" — Marco doesn't care)
- Auto-updates Trifecta dashboard after each run
- Results: All 166 ASINs = Active

**Cron setup:**
- 1 AM CST: Silent check (ID: `e814061c-91c3-4c7e-a857-f958252b394e`)
- 7 AM CST: Report to Marco (ID: `d09cbf74-b0e2-4ff2-a651-f1507ae629c8`)

**Data cleanup:** Removed 20 fake "Random" test ASINs from master list. Now 166 real ASINs (48 Black Owned, 72 Card Plug, 46 Kinfolk).

## Etsy → MCF Automation (In Progress)

Guided Marco through API setup:

**Etsy:**
- Provided full instructions for creating API app at partners.etsy.com
- Needs: API Key, Shared Secret, Shop ID

**Amazon SP-API:**
- Walked through Developer Central registration
- Identity verified, data access roles selected (Amazon Fulfillment, Inventory and Order Tracking)
- Security questions answered
- Marco on final step: click "Register" button
- Needs: Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token, Seller ID

**Blocked:** Waiting for Marco to complete registration and send credentials.

## Key Lesson

**Script > LLM for iteration logic:**
- Scripts don't hallucinate, don't skip items, don't add confusion
- Use LLM for interpretation/reporting, not for checking every item in a list
- This is now documented in MEMORY.md

---

## Next Steps

1. Marco completes Amazon SP-API registration
2. Marco sends all credentials (Etsy + Amazon for Card Plug)
3. Build Etsy→Amazon MCF automation script
4. Test with real order
5. Set to poll every 5 minutes
6. Replicate for Black Owned and Kinfolk
