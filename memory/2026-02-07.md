## Bug Fixes

**05:40 CST - ASIN Checker Discord Posting Fixed**

Marco reported not receiving the daily ASIN check report. Investigation revealed:

**Root Cause:**
- Cron job runs `asin_checker_browser.py` (browser version to avoid Amazon detection)
- That script was missing the `post_to_discord()` function
- Only the old `asin_checker.py` (HTTP version) had Discord posting
- Script ran successfully at 1:10 AM but results never posted to Discord

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `post_to_discord()` function to `asin_checker_browser.py`
- Copied implementation from the working `asin_checker.py`
- Tested successfully with fake data
- Manually posted today's actual results to #reports + #alerts

**Today's ASIN Check Results (Feb 7, 1:10 AM):**
- ✅ **157 Active**
- 🚨 **3 Suppressed** (Charades & Chill, LIT, The South - all Black Owned)
- ❌ **6 Errors** (timeouts on slow-loading pages)
- 📦 **166 Total**

**What Marco will see tomorrow:**
- Automated post to #reports (summary)
- Automated post to #alerts (if suppressions found)
- No more missed notifications

**Files modified:**
- `/workspace/scripts/asin_checker_browser.py` (added Discord posting)
- `/workspace/SCHEDULED_TASKS.md` (logged the fix)
