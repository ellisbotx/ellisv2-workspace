## Development Projects

**11:10 CST - Command Center Build Initiated**

Marco requested a comprehensive Command Center dashboard to monitor all my activities. Spawned Codex to build it out.

**Requirements:**
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js (framework) + Convex (database)
- **Location:** `/workspace/command-center/`

**Feature 1: Activity Feed**
- Record EVERY action I complete (ASIN checks, reports, file updates, etc.)
- Show timestamp, action type, description, outcome, related files, which agent
- Filterable by date, action type, agent, status
- Infinite scroll, newest first

**Feature 2: Calendar View**
- Weekly view of all scheduled tasks
- Shows upcoming, running, completed, failed tasks
- Displays last run + next run timestamps
- Clean visual layout

**Feature 3: Global Search**
- Search across MEMORY.md, memory/*.md, all workspace docs, activity history, tasks
- Fast, fuzzy search with results grouped by type
- Highlight matching terms
- Search-as-you-type

**Implementation:**
- Convex backend for activities, tasks, document index
- Next.js frontend with 3 main pages
- Logging utilities for agents to call after actions
- Seed from existing SCHEDULED_TASKS.md and memory logs
- Deploy to Vercel + Convex cloud

**Status:** In progress (Codex building)
**Session:** agent:code:subagent:d86d7f51-ed2b-4a05-8dba-76c3628de4b8

**Why this matters:**
- Marco gets full visibility into everything I do
- Historical record of all actions and outcomes
- Easy to search past work and decisions
- Calendar view prevents tasks from being forgotten
- Central dashboard for the entire operation

## Bug Fixes

**05:40 CST (Feb 7) - ASIN Checker Discord Posting Fixed**

Marco reported not receiving the daily ASIN check report. Investigation revealed:

**Root Cause:**
- Cron job runs `asin_checker_browser.py` (browser version to avoid Amazon detection)
- That script was missing the `post_to_discord()` function
- Only the old `asin_checker.py` (HTTP version) had Discord posting
- Script ran successfully at 1 AM but results never posted to Discord

**Fix:**
- Added `post_to_discord()` function to `asin_checker_browser.py`
- Copied from the working version in `asin_checker.py`
- Tested successfully
- Manually posted today's results to #reports + #alerts

**Results:**
- ✅ 157 Active
- 🚨 3 Suppressed (Charades & Chill, LIT, The South - all Black Owned)
- ❌ 6 Errors (timeouts)

Tomorrow's 1 AM run will now post automatically. ✅
