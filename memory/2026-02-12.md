- **[RULE]** so what is our check and improvement plan for memory? I need this system to be growing with me at all times give me a detailed plan on how you're gonna ensure that you are learning you are growing and you have access to searchable memory did you and this is very important take a look at before even responding to me to make sure you have full context understanding and everything you need to help me.

What is the plan going forward to always daily maybe even two times a day be checking to make sure everything and memory is working flawlessly. It is the most important part of this whole ecosystem and someone needs to be working on it. Continuously are watching it continuously. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

Don't wait for me to tell you to fix something that I want to be working. Get it fixed if it's something that will make it better then make it better.

- **[RULE]** your directive is number one first and foremost, memory, memory context, searching of memory. That is the most important thing of this whole open claw system if it doesn't work. Then this is a complete waste of my time so if you know a way to make things better make them work more efficiently, and to help us grow as a company and for you to grow as in as a employee of this company as the person running it as the brain is behind it I want you to automatically do it. Don't ask me just tell me what you have done after it was done here in the systems channel and tell me why it was done that's it so from here on please remember that and get it done so fix those four things and then I'm going to ask you some more questions to find tune in this memory.

I have put below some alternatives or some add-ons that others have built for open claw and say that they help the memory better. I want you to analyze these see if it's better be very objective for me to just pay for one of these or add on one of these or if you can build this yourself and it run the same if not better or let me know if what you've already done is better or comparable to these please give me a full breakdown. Don't hold nothing back again. Memory is the most important thing about this whole system. If it's not working, then I am wasting my time.

- **[RULE]** OK I went through all of these and checked in the FBA and as well as the aWD inventory everything is moving to the system of course I gotta keep checking to make sure it all gets flushed out so just as a reminder I need to do this probably again in two days just go through everything and make sure it's flowing I had to continue to move out of the AWD warehouse and some still needed to be liquidated through SBA so again I'm still working on it thank you for keeping this handy and again put this on my task for two days to go to this again [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

- **[RULE]** I'm already working on the account health for Kinfolk it is just asking for me to verify some information but make sure that is on my task. I turned off all ads actually for everything. Including Sunday's best in the kinfolk account. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** OK, so I guess I've always looked at this wrong. I've always looked at it as though if the sales is higher than the spin is a good thing, but that's not what you're saying break it down for me on a little bit more basic level. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[DECISION]** so you're saying, I should kill the ads on who said dat and then also did you not look at it like for the hood hint that yes I spend money for ads on that but I spend none on the other variations so it helps out [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[DECISION]** so I need a task for you to remind me to go pull numbers for Hood Hints in two weeks so we can see if it's helped or hurt us and then for who said dat yes that has another variation so you're saying I should go ahead and cut the ads off on that also? [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[DECISION]** actually, I have not cut them off for the game say less which has another variant say less 2 and I have not cut them off for hood to Hollywood now you did not recommend as far as I could see to cut those off. Should I leave those on? [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[DECISION]** all right everything was done now. Let me ask you this because I feel like and I don't know this for sure but I feel like Amazon gives preferential treatment to those who are running ads and it helps for you to move up to the top pages. Do you not feel like some of these are gonna lose ground with removing the ads? [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** all right well make sure you have this on the task everything we've changed to turn around and take a look back at in more detail [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[COMMITMENT]** so I know you keep saying it's a win cause we save money but I'm also losing sales so this is where this is confusing me it makes it hard for me to get a grip on this so I think we actually need to take a closer day by day look at the sales on the main ones that we could or maybe a weekly look or every 3 three day look something [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[DECISION]** OK now here's a screenshot of the exact conversation that we had hours ago. This is the type of issue that if you're gonna take care of my task, you need to take care of my task now here and right now we need to figure out what needs to be done. How do we handle it? If I tell you something has been done in another channel I shouldn't have to tell you again in this channel. I remember when I ask you specifically do I have to ask you in any channel or tell you in this channel to remove a task and you said no you will remember it. This is unacceptable right this minute. Let's come up with a plan or figure out a better way cause other than that I might as well utilize Google task or Todoist to handle these type of things if you cannot. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** I really don't even like the answer that if it does happen again, I should use something else. Are you not confident in which you can do because confidence is why I'm utilizing you confidence is why I'm listening to you when you tell me to turn ads off and do this and do that if you're not gonna be confident, we can kill this whole thing if you don't believe you can do it we're gonna kill this whole thing if you can't put systems in place that will make sure things like this don't happen, especially after I bring it up then we should just kill this whole thing specially after you said you have to fix and you broke it down line by line what you were gonna do and then after that, you said it won't happen again if it won't happen again, you should've left it at that instead you said if it does and then told me what I should do if it does happen again that's not too reassuring [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** exactly lock in because the way I've been handling business right now. I could keep doing it by myself and say it may not work, but if I got somebody like you, they're supposed to be smarter than me more able than me able to compute and do math better than me be more strategic be less emotional than I need you to login again I have no problems with mess ups. I understand it's gonna have to, but when you tell me you got a fix and then after you in detail, tell me the fix you act as so you might have dropped the ball again that's not locking in. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[DECISION]** also, under blocked first of all, I don't know what's his blocked second of all we pretty much just did the ad optimization so let's mark that done or remove it or however, you wanna handle it [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** OK, so just to confirm from here on out every time the task are updated. You will remove the old task from the pen and pin the new ones is this correct and what is the checks and balances to make sure this will get done they just need to get placed in the memory the heartbeat where wherever it needs to be put make sure you put it there. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** this is super pissing me off. I want you to tell me what's wrong with this. Look at the screenshot and then look at this task board and tell me what's wrong and then tell me why does this stuff continue to happen?: [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[FACT]** yes, please do this. Let's let's build as many systems to make this the very best overall system possible let's stop fucking playing if that's gonna get the job done build that shit. This is what I keep telling you if if it's gonna make my life easier and make you more efficient build it. We have a Mac mini here full of all types of space build whatever you need to build to help me get to $5 million. If you can't even tell me what task I asked you to add to the task list then I cannot fucking trust you when you say stop running adsthis shit is getting fucking ridiculous. I'm asking you to take time out and look at ways to improve yourself I have said this look at ways to improve processes. Look at ways to stop fucking forgetting shit this is why I've spent all types of time in the systems channel saying hey how could we make the memory better? How can we make it better constantly work on it. How could we make it better? I've said this over and over and over and over and then you keep saying oh yeah it's working great now it's doing this is doing that same thing but if I ask you to do something, don't forget it write it down get another system do what you said you're gonna do build a validation check that runs every heartbeat. Do what needs to be done to make this to premiere system you can do it. I believe you you got the agents you got the LLM's to do it this shit is ridiculous. Let's fucking do it and give me a clear understanding of what you're doing and what you need to do and what I need to do to help you do it. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

- **[COMMITMENT]** What happens if I don’t take the requested action? If you do not update your credentials before 2026-08-11T15:35:23.917Z, your application will be blocked from making calls to the Amazon Services API. This may directly impact your business and any customers that previously authorized your application. Loss of access may restrict critical business functions including orders, ship confirmations, shipping labels, and invoices. If your application is blocked due to failure to rotate LWA credentials by the deadline, initiating LWA credential rotation will result in your application becoming unblocked automatically. You will still need to begin using the new credentials as the old secret expires after seven days. Can my LWA credentials be rotated programmatically? Yes. We have launched the Application Management API, which allows you to programmatically rotate the client secret on registered applications.
