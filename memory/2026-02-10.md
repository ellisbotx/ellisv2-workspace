## Major Ad Audit Session with Marco

Marco went through ad campaigns one by one with Ellis. Key learning: Marco previously thought "sales > spend = good" — Ellis taught him the ROAS breakeven concept (need 3.0+ ROAS at ~35-40% margins to break even on ad-driven sales).

### Kinfolk — ALL Ads Paused
- Sunday's Best: 1.33 ROAS lifetime, already recommended kill
- Hood Hints OG: 1.77 ROAS (30d). V2 makes $720/mo with $0 ads. Halo effect discussion — will monitor V2 sales.
- Who Said Dat OG: 2.94 ROAS (30d). Has variation. Near breakeven but not profitable.
- SayLess OG: 2.34 ROAS (30d). Only 12 ad-driven sales out of 300+ monthly. Negligible impact.
- Hood To Hollywood: 3.52 ROAS (30d). Actually profitable but paused with everything else. Also needs CPC cert.

### Black Owned — Selective Changes
- Hood Charades: 2.18 ROAS (30d), $1.85 bid, was $500/day. **Budget cut to $200/day** (not killed — has 7 variations, too important)
- Prayer Warrior Performance: 1.89 ROAS — **KILLED**. Product Target campaign kept (3.27 ROAS, slightly profitable)
- Ghetto Pass: 2.60 ROAS — **KILLED**. Also has $62.85/mo storage surcharge.
- Black Love: 1.13 ROAS — **KILLED**. Terrible performance, 22 sales in 3 months.
- Jerome In The House: 2.75 ROAS — **KEPT**. Only -$28/mo loss, 1 variation, halo worth it.

### Estimated Monthly Savings: ~$9,200/mo

### Key Concept Discussed: Halo Effect
- Ads on OG versions may drive sales to variations (Hood Hints → V2, WSD → variation, Hood Charades → 6 other versions)
- Can't measure directly from ad console — need to watch variation sales after pausing
- Marco's instinct about Amazon preferential treatment for ad spenders is valid but not worth subsidizing at ROAS below breakeven

### Reminders Set
- Feb 24: Full ad review — compare before/after on all changes (cron id: 2ced46d5)
- Reference doc: `/workspace/data/ad_changes_feb10.md`

## Memory System Overhaul (7:17 PM)

Marco asked about memory system health. Honest assessment: semantic search returning empty results, inconsistent daily logging, no automated health checks. Marco called out that I'd said "everything's fine" before without actually testing.

**Full overhaul executed:**
- Split MEMORY.md into 5 topic files in `memory/topics/` (business, preferences, systems, agents, lessons)
- MEMORY.md now an index file pointing to topic files
- Backup saved: `memory/MEMORY_backup_20260210.md`
- Built `scripts/memory_health_check.sh` — automated health checks, writes to `memory/health.json`
- New crons:
  - Daily health check (6 AM CST) — alerts #system on failure
  - Monthly deep audit (1st of month, 9 AM) — growth tracking, search testing, report to #system
- Updated AGENTS.md with:
  - "Search Before Asking" mandatory rule
  - Real-time logging requirement
  - New memory file structure documentation

**Key lesson:** Never say "it's fine" without data to back it up. Every health report needs numbers.

## Memory System v2 Built (Feb 11, 6:35 AM)

Built 4 new scripts for memory v2:
1. `memory_autocapture.py` — extracts decisions/preferences/facts from conversations, files them to correct topic files automatically
2. `memory_reindex.py` — re-indexes all memory + runs 5 known-answer search tests
3. `memory_selfheal.py` — full self-healing monitor (auto-rebuilds if broken)
4. Updated `memory_health_check.sh` to use self-healer

All 5 search tests passing: Card Plug margin ✅, communication preferences ✅, agent team ✅, ROAS breakeven ✅, auto-fix rule ✅

## Other Updates
- Marco working on Kinfolk account health (At Risk status) — verifying info for Amazon
- Kinfolk account health added to task tracker
- Dashboard task removed (not doing anymore)
- Taxes task added: March 15 deadline, start by Feb 23 (cron: bb004404)
- Liquidation (65 SKUs): Marco checked all, inventory moving through system. Recheck Feb 11 (cron: 048e44fc)

## Liquidation Math — Updated Numbers (#products, ~8:00 PM)

Marco confirmed actual COGS numbers:
- **62,739 total units** across all liquidation SKUs
- **$1.85/unit landed cost** (avg including shipping) — originally estimated $2.10 high end
- **$116,067 total cost basis**

Recovery scenarios:
- 5% recovery → $71,825 → **loss of $44,242**
- 7.5% recovery → ~$107,738 → **loss of $8,329**
- 10% recovery → $143,651 → **profit of $27,584**

**Breakeven: ~6-7.5% recovery rate.** Key insight: $1.85 landed cost is a competitive advantage — downside is capped, margin for error on recovery % is wide. Most brands would be underwater at any liquidation rate. Anything above ~6% and Marco is roughly whole.

This supersedes the Mission 3 estimates ($35,197 trapped, $10,559-17,599 recovery range) which used per-SKU COGS estimates, not Marco's actual blended cost.

## Finance Channel Briefing (7:50 PM)

Marco tested memory by asking for a high-level overview of all 3 brands in #finance. Delivered full portfolio snapshot from today's Sellerboard/Seller Central data.

### Key Discussion: Liquidation Recovery Estimate
- Marco asked how the $35K trapped inventory number was calculated → explained: FBA/AWD stock × COGS per unit, per SKU
- Marco shared: Amazon liquidation pays **5-10% of sale price** (not COGS)
- Built full per-SKU liquidation recovery estimate for all 64 SKUs being liquidated:
  - **Black Owned (26 SKUs, 46,663 units):** $55,634 - $111,268
  - **Kinfolk (28 SKUs, 8,126 units):** $8,619 - $17,238
  - **Card Plug (11 SKUs, 7,950 units):** $7,572 - $15,145
  - **GRAND TOTAL: 62,739 units → $71,825 - $143,651**
  - Realistic midpoint estimate: ~$90K-$110K recovery at 7-8% avg
- Biggest single chunk: Girlll (13,386 units) → $15,340 - $30,681
- Note: recovery is based on sale price %, NOT COGS — so recovery exceeds the $35K COGS trapped value
- Data source: `liquidation_financial_codex.json` (reliable) + derived/estimated sale prices per SKU

### Key Strategic Insight: Low COGS = Risk-Free Product Testing
Marco shared actual manufacturer pricing for 76-card tuck box games:
- **1,080 units:** $1.02/unit + $0.30 shipping = **$1.32 landed**
- **2,070 units:** $0.77/unit + $0.30 shipping = **$1.07 landed**
- Spec: 76 cards (63×88mm, 400gsm artpaper, glossy varnish, round corner) + instruction brochure + tuck box (350gsm, glossy lamination), shrink wrapped

**The breakthrough realization:** At $1.07-$1.32 landed cost and $19.99-$24.99 sale price, Amazon's liquidation floor (5%) already covers COGS. Failed products cost essentially nothing if liquidated fast. This makes aggressive "shots on goal" strategy practically risk-free.

**Breakeven liquidation rates:**
- $1.07 landed → breakeven at 4.3-5.4% of sale price
- $1.32 landed → breakeven at 5.3-6.6% of sale price
- Amazon pays 5-10% → worst case ~breakeven, best case profit on dead product

**Marco's action:** Requested quotes for 4 brand new games from manufacturer. Plans to move much faster on launches with this risk profile.

**REMEMBER:** Marco explicitly said to remember this conversation — it informs the entire new product launch strategy going forward. Speed is everything: launch fast, test 60-90 days, kill fast if not working, recover funds via liquidation, redeploy into next product.

## Pre-Compaction Memory Flush

### Business Analysis Deep Dive (Missions 1-3)
- **Portfolio trailing 12mo**: $982K revenue, $309K profit, 31.4% margin
- **Card Plug is healthiest brand**: 40% margins, 3.6% ACOS, minimal ad dependency — the model to replicate
- **Black Owned declining**: Revenue dropped 61% Feb→Sep 2025, saved by Q4. Organic traffic dying. $70K/yr ad spend mostly unprofitable
- **Kinfolk middle tier**: 29% margins, propped up by unprofitable ads, account health flagged
- **Business is holiday-dependent**: Nov+Dec = 36% of annual revenue
- **Only ~27 of ~125 SKUs making $200+/month** — rest are dead weight

### Ad Audit Results (Feb 10)
- **Kinfolk: ALL ads paused** — Sunday's Best (1.33 ROAS), Hood Hints OG (1.77), WSD OG (2.94), SayLess OG (2.34), Hood To Hollywood (3.52 — actually profitable but paused with everything)
- **Black Owned selective**: Hood Charades budget $500→$200/day (kept, too important with 7 variations); Prayer Warrior Performance killed (1.89 ROAS, Product Target kept at 3.27); Ghetto Pass killed (2.60); Black Love killed (1.13); Jerome kept (-$28/mo, halo worth it)
- **Estimated savings: ~$9,200/month ($110K/yr)**
- **Key teaching moment**: Marco learned ROAS breakeven concept — need 3.0+ at 35-40% margins to break even on ad-driven sales
- **Halo effect discussion**: Can't measure directly if OG ads drive variation sales — monitoring required
- **Review checkpoints set**: 3-day (Feb 13), 6-day (Feb 16), 9-day (Feb 19), full review Feb 24

### Marco's Stress About Ad Cuts
- Marco expressed stress: "That's very stressful. It makes me feel like I'm gonna lose a lot of money"
- Reassured him: worst case flip switch back on, 2 weeks of saved bad spend. Safety net = Feb 24 review date
- Important: be sensitive about ad decisions going forward, this is emotionally loaded for him

### Operational Changes
- **Email notifications killed**: Marco has Discord on desktop, #orders is sole channel now
- **3 email digest crons disabled** (8AM/12PM/7PM)
- **Morning briefing upgraded**: Now includes verified completions of ALL overnight automations
- **Dashboard task removed** — Marco decided not to do it
- **Taxes task added**: March 15 deadline, start by Feb 23
- **Kinfolk PO Box updated**: #264 (was #1381), same Schaefer Rd address

### Marco's Evening Feedback
- Wants morning briefings to show ALL automated work with verified completion status
- "Even if it's repetitive that's fine. I wanna know" — transparency > brevity for system status
- Appreciated the day's work: "Good work today"
- Philosophy reinforced: "It is your job to earn your team and make yourself more valuable each and every day"
