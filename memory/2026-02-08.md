## Major Session — Proactive Systems & Business Infrastructure

### Proactive Automation Launched
Marco told me to stop asking and start doing. Built and activated 4 new automated systems:

**Daily (7:00-7:05 AM CST):**
1. `inventory_alert.py` → #inventory (flags SKUs below 90/120/190 day thresholds)
2. `sales_anomaly.py` → #alerts/#reports (flags >40% drops or >50% spikes)

**Weekly (Monday 7:00-7:15 AM CST):**
3. `weekly_health_report.py` → #reports (revenue, units, profit, top/bottom SKUs)
4. `reorder_recommendations.py` → #inventory (ranked by profit 50%, urgency 35%, velocity 15%)

All cron jobs created and active.

### New Discord Channels Created
- **#braindump** (1470095205205283022) — Marco's second brain for walking ideas, shower thoughts
- **#growth** (1470178653932355798) — 27 business growth opportunities tracked
- **#tasks** (1470181819067531500) — Task management system with daily 9 AM board updates
- **#taxes** (1470205780081905777) — Accountable plan reimbursements, tax documents

### Ideas Vault / Second Brain
- Created `/workspace/data/ideas_vault.md` for capturing and organizing Marco's ideas
- Flow: Marco dumps ideas anywhere → I capture, tag, research, connect, follow up
- Categories: Raw Ideas → Connected → Researched → Actionable → Archived

### Task Management System
- Created `/workspace/data/task_tracker.md`
- Three buckets: 🟢 Ellis Handles, 🟡 Marco Action, 🔴 Blocked
- Daily 9 AM cron posts updated board to #tasks
- **RULE:** Every task gets written to file AND posted to #tasks. Discord notification = confirmation it's saved.
- Marco can tell me tasks ANYWHERE — I add them to tracker regardless of channel

### Growth Opportunities
- Collected 27 business growth ideas in `/workspace/data/growth_opportunities.md`
- Posted to #growth channel
- Categories: competitor intel, listing optimization, review mining, bundles, A+ content, Amazon Posts, seasonal calendar, influencer seeding, international expansion, wholesale/B2B, etc.

### Accountable Plan Automation
- Marco shared his expense reimbursement form (DOCX)
- Redesigned as clean one-page PDF — template locked in
- **$292.54 per business × 3 businesses = $877.62/month total**
- Pay to: Shawnta Grier, 209 Jade Cv, Cibolo, TX 78108, 405-500-2525
- 28.5% home office allocation
- Approved by: Marco Grier
- Monthly cron set for 5th of each month at 9 AM
- PDFs go to #taxes channel
- Marco needs to verify amounts are still accurate for 2026
- Template saved: `/workspace/data/accountable_plan/template_locked.pdf`
- Generation script uses reportlab Python library

### Wife's Discord Server Setup
- Marco wants separate Discord server for his wife
- Same bot, separate agent profile with own personality/memory
- Bot Application ID: 1468684601089064962
- Invite link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1468684601089064962&permissions=412317240384&scope=bot
- Steps: Create server → invite bot → send server ID → I configure agent
- Server nickname can be different from "Ellis"
- On Marco's task list for when she's available

### Key Lessons
- **"Stop asking, start doing"** — If I know it benefits the business and I have access, just do it
- **Every task must post to #tasks** — Discord notification is the confirmation. No notification = didn't happen.
- **Batch tasks, don't itemize** — "Audit all listings" not 35 separate tasks
- **Marco can tell me tasks anywhere** — I route them to the tracker regardless of channel

### Liquidation Analysis (completed Feb 5, reported today)
- All 65 SKUs being liquidated — decision is final
- Net impact: -$218/quarter loss in profit
- One-time capital recovery: ~$25K
- Storage savings don't offset lost profit from 32 profitable SKUs on the list
- Posted validated analysis to #analytics
