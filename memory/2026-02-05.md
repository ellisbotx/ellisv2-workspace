## System Updates

**16:17 CST - Scheduled Tasks Protocol Implemented**

Marco requested a new accountability system for scheduled tasks:
- Created `SCHEDULED_TASKS.md` to track all scheduled tasks, completions, and overdue items
- Updated `HEARTBEAT.md` to mandate checking SCHEDULED_TASKS.md on every heartbeat
- If anything is overdue: run it immediately or explain why it didn't run
- All task completions must be logged with timestamp and outcome

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures no tasks slip through the cracks due to cron failures, bugs, or oversight
- Creates audit trail of all automation activity
- Makes me accountable for following through on scheduled work
- Gives Marco visibility into what's running when

**Current scheduled tasks:**
1. Daily ASIN suppression check (1 AM CST) - last ran successfully today at 1:09 AM
2. Weekly memory consolidation (Sundays 8 PM CST) - next run Feb 9
3. Hourly heartbeat proactive checks - ongoing

Updated files:
- `/workspace/SCHEDULED_TASKS.md` (created)
- `/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md` (updated with mandatory check)
- `/workspace/MEMORY.md` (documented protocol, updated to 2026-02-05)
- `/workspace/memory/2026-02-05.md` (this file)
