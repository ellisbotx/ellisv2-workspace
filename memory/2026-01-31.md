# 2026-01-31 - Day One Operations

## Sellerboard Access Confirmed
- Successfully logged in via browser automation
- Can switch between all 3 accounts from dropdown in top-right:
  - **Black Owned** (srgrier45@gmail.com)
  - **CardPlug**
  - **Kinfolk**
- Pulled January 2026 MTD data from all 3 brands
- Data files saved to `data/` folder

## January 2026 Portfolio Snapshot
| Brand | Sales | Profit | Margin | YoY Sales | YoY Profit |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Black Owned | $17,863 | $3,587 | 20.1% | -72.1% | -84.6% |
| CardPlug | $19,636 | $7,902 | 40.2% | -74.1% | -78.3% |
| Kinfolk | $15,103 | $3,444 | 22.8% | -76.0% | -86.2% |
| **TOTAL** | **$52,602** | **$14,933** | **28.4%** | ~-74% | ~-83% |

Significant YoY decline across all brands — needs investigation. Post-holiday slump expected but this is steeper than typical seasonality.

## Sellerboard Data Extraction
- **Method:** Direct browser scraping (Excel export failed due to download path issues in openclaw profile)
- **Files created:**
  - `data/sellerboard_blackowned_jan2026.md`
  - `data/sellerboard_cardplug_jan2026.md`
  - `data/sellerboard_kinfolk_jan2026.md`
- Process is repeatable for monthly pulls

## Security Hardening
- Created `SECURITY.md` with prompt injection defense guidelines
- Created `memory/security-incidents.md` for logging suspicious activity
- Current config is solid: Telegram allowlist, pairing mode, loopback gateway

## Communication Structure Decision
**Option 3 chosen:** Single Telegram DM + sub-agents for heavy work
- Keep main chat responsive
- Spawn sub-agents for reports, analysis, long-running tasks
- Sub-agents report back when done

## Trifecta Dashboard V1 Created
- Location: `trifecta/index.html`
- Dark mode, desktop-optimized
- Shows: 30-day sales, 30-day profit, profit margin
- Brand breakdown cards (color-coded)
- Alerts section (low stock, high refunds, top performers)
- Icon: Triangle (▲) representing 3 brands
- Currently static - can wire to auto-refresh from Sellerboard

## Marco's Preferences Learned
- Dark mode
- Desktop user
- Key metrics: Sales, Profit, Margin
- Comparison period: 30 days
- Solo user (one-man army)
- Prefers direct, get-things-done approach

## ASIN Suppression Monitoring System (Evening)

### Master ASIN List Created
- **Source:** Google Sheet `1zz3kcF5eMUgDBCQUnK7bZjjLrNUkT566yEoVeK4Tt1c`
- **File:** `data/asin_master_list.csv` (186 ASINs total)
- **Breakdown:**
  - Black Owned: 48 ASINs
  - Card Plug: 92 ASINs
  - Kinfolk: 46 ASINs

### Cron Jobs Configured
1. **Daily Suppression Check** (1 AM CST)
   - Job ID: `e814061c-91c3-4c7e-a857-f958252b394e`
   - Opens Amazon, searches each ASIN, flags if wrong product appears
   - Saves results to `data/suppression_tracker.csv`
   
2. **3-Day Summary Report** (7 AM CST, every 3 days starting Feb 1)
   - Job ID: `b2f919d3-7f8e-4cf5-b71b-4adb6e1aecd1`
   - Reports suppression changes to Marco via Telegram

### Suppression Detection Logic
- Search Amazon for each ASIN
- If result shows unrelated product (not a card game), it's suppressed
- `web_fetch` gives false positives due to anti-bot; browser automation required
- Tracker file: `data/suppression_tracker.csv`

### Dashboard Updated
- Added "ASIN Suppression Monitor" section to Trifecta
- Shows all-clear state (green) or issues (red)
- Brand breakdown with counts
- Ready to display suppressed items when they occur

### USER.md Updated
- Added communication preferences section
- Proactive notifications: 7 AM - 9 PM CST only
- Responding to Marco: Anytime

## Pending
- First automated suppression check runs tonight at 1 AM
- Need to send dashboard screenshot to Marco (in media folder)
- Dashboard screenshot: `/Users/ellisbot/.openclaw/media/browser/f587b327-03ac-42b8-9d22-da947513c6bc.png`
