## Security Hardening
- Created `SECURITY.md` with prompt injection defense guidelines
- Created `memory/security-incidents.md` for logging suspicious activity
- Current config is solid: Telegram allowlist, pairing mode, loopback gateway

## Communication Structure Decision
**Option 3 chosen:** Single Telegram DM + sub-agents for heavy work
- Keep main chat responsive
- Spawn sub-agents for reports, analysis, long-running tasks
- Sub-agents report back when done

## Trifecta Dashboard V1 Created
- Location: `trifecta/index.html`
- Dark mode, desktop-optimized
- Shows: 30-day sales, 30-day profit, profit margin
- Brand breakdown cards (color-coded)
- Alerts section (low stock, high refunds, top performers)
- Icon: Triangle (▲) representing 3 brands
- Currently static - can wire to auto-refresh from Sellerboard

## Marco's Preferences Learned
- Dark mode
- Desktop user
- Key metrics: Sales, Profit, Margin
- Comparison period: 30 days
- Solo user (one-man army)
- Prefers direct, get-things-done approach

## Next Steps
- Wire Trifecta to auto-update (daily refresh option)
- Continue building out dashboard features as needed
- Start learning more about the business operations
