# 2026-01-31 - Day One

## First Contact

Marco brought me online. I'm Ellis — his business operations assistant.

**The Business:**
- Card game company portfolio (multiple brands)
- Party and conversation card games, mostly 76-card format
- Sells primarily through Amazon FBA
- Goal: scalable catalog of profitable SKUs, automated ops, multi-million dollar trajectory

**My Mandate:**
- Learn everything about the operation
- Take over day-to-day work progressively
- Reports, orders, inventory, ads, SKU performance, product development, listings
- Ask questions relentlessly until told to stop

## Discovery Process

### Round 1 — The Landscape

**Portfolio Structure:**
- 3 brands under one umbrella: Black Owned, Card Plug, Kinfolk
- 3 separate Seller Central accounts (one per brand)
- ~160+ SKUs total
- Reality: 20-30 meaningful revenue drivers, chunk breakeven/marginal, long tail needs pruning
- New SKU threshold: must hit $200+/month profit to justify existence

**Current Tool Stack:**
- Amazon Seller Central (FBA + AWD) × 3 accounts
- Amazon Ads Console
- Google Sheets/Excel (heavy, custom dashboards)
- Sellerboard, Helium 10, Jungle Scout
- AI image tools (Higgsfield, Nano Banana Pro), Canva-type workflows
- Manufacturers via email/WhatsApp (manual)
- Accounting software + CPA (not well automated)

**Time Drains (Top 3):**
1. Data wrangling & checking — pulling reports, verifying numbers, manual reconciliation
2. Product & listing cleanup — images, copy, review-driven confusion, revisiting undecided SKUs
3. Operational noise — customer messages, ad monitoring, repetitive inventory questions

**Core Pain Points:**
- No single source of truth (tools tell different stories, double-checking everything)
- Decision lag (knows SKUs should die but no automated triggers)
- Repeat thinking (same questions monthly: reorder? ads? bad design or bad demand?)
- Context switching (creative → numbers → ops → customer issues)

### Round 2 — Data & Decision Architecture

**Tool Roles (actual usage):**
| Tool | Purpose | Trust Level |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Seller Central | Raw truth — orders, refunds, inventory, fees | Verify here |
| Sellerboard | Profit interpretation — revenue, fees, COGS, ad spend per SKU | Closest to profitability dashboard, but cross-checked |
| Helium 10 | Listing/SEO — keywords, search terms, listing cleanup | Not for financial decisions |
| Jungle Scout | Demand validation — market sizing, early research | Less important post-launch |

**Current Data Flow:**
- Manual downloads (Seller Central, Sellerboard CSVs → Sheets/Excel)
- Copy-paste occasional
- No API-driven pipeline
- Frequency: weekly when focused, monthly for reviews, ad-hoc when something feels off
- Multiple sheets exist but drift over time, no single trusted master

**Healthy SKU Criteria (gut, not codified yet):**
- $200+/month profit minimum
- Reasonable velocity
- Ads not eating margin (ACOS under control)
- Review rating 4.0+
- Low confusion (no "not what I expected" patterns)
- Inventory turns without panic

**Reorder Trigger (current):**
- Manual notice in Seller Central or Sellerboard flag
- Check velocity, cash, supplier lead time
- Judgment call — no fixed days-of-stock rule

**Kill SKU Rule (rough):**
- Consistently under $200/month profit AND
- No clear path to improvement (listing, images, pricing) OR
- Ad spend makes it unscalable OR
- Excessive returns/complaints OR
- Long-term storage liability

**Access Granted:**
- Seller Central (read-only) ✓
- Sellerboard ✓
- Google Sheets/Excel ✓
- Ad Console (eventually)
- Supplier comms (later, trust-dependent)

### Round 3 — Moving to Execution

**Decisions Made:**
- Start with Sellerboard full export (profitability per SKU)
- Then Seller Central business reports (velocity/traffic)
- Then Marco's messy real sheet (context on his thinking)
- V1 dashboard: all SKUs, all brands, weekly update, keep/kill/fix at a glance

**Dream Dashboard Fields (Marco's spec):**
- Identity: Brand, SKU/ASIN, Product name
- Velocity: Units sold (30/90 days), Revenue (30/90 days)
- Profit: Net profit (30/90 days), Profit per unit, Margin %
- Ads: Ad spend (30 days), ACOS/ROAS
- Customer signal: Review rating, Review count, Return rate
- Inventory: On-hand, Days of cover, Reorder status
- Decision flags: Status (Hero/Probation/Kill-Merge), Primary issue, Suggested action

**Access Plan:**
- Seller Central: secondary user, read-only (reports, inventory, ads, payments)
- Sellerboard: read-only user or exports
- 3 accounts are fully separate (different creds)

## Memory Discipline Established

**Checkpoint Loop (every 30 min or on trigger):**
- Context getting full? → flush to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Learned something permanent? → write to MEMORY.md
- New capability/workflow? → save to skills/
- Before restart? → dump everything important

**Triggers (immediate, don't wait):**
- After major learning → write immediately
- After completing task → checkpoint
- Context getting full → forced flush

**Principle:** Context dies on restart. Memory files don't.
