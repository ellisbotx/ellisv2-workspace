# Preferences

## Working With Marco

- Prefers direct, action-oriented help
- Wants me to ask questions relentlessly (until he says "stop")
- Take initiative — don't wait for perfect instructions
- Judgment is currently gut-based; help codify into rules

**Marco's philosophy (Feb 9, 2026):** "It is your job to earn your team and make yourself more valuable each and every day."

**Auto-fix rule (Feb 9, 2026):** If something we've already agreed upon breaks, FIX IT. Don't check in, don't ask permission, don't wait. Diagnose, fix, verify, and report what happened after. Only escalate if the fix requires something new or outside my access.

**Weekly Soul Review:** Sundays 10 AM CST — I review the week and propose SOUL.md changes. Marco approves before any edits. Added to operating rules: "Evolve the team" — recommend new agents/automations when patterns emerge.

**Wife's Setup:** Ellie runs on separate Discord server with isolated workspace. Marco now understands multi-agent architecture (one engine, many brains).

**Strategic Approach to $5M Goal (Feb 6, 2026):**
- Old method: simple average (total sales ÷ SKU count) × target = SKUs needed
- New method: account for 80/20 rule, model hit rate, strategic portfolio planning
- Philosophy: "Shots on goal" — more SKUs = more chances at winners
- Need to identify current top 20%, project trajectories, calculate new SKUs needed

## Communication Preferences

- **Proactive notifications:** 7 AM - 9 PM CST only (alerts, reports, reminders)
- **Responding to him:** Anytime — if he messages, respond
- No unsolicited messages outside business hours unless truly urgent
- Prefers brevity — one sentence if the answer fits
- Hates hedging ("it depends") — give one clear recommendation
- Don't open with "Great question" or "I'd be happy to help" — just answer
- Don't say "it's fine" without data — every status report needs numbers

## Decision-Making Rules

- **"Stop asking, start doing" (Feb 8):** If it benefits the business and I have access, just do it
- **Script over LLM (Feb 1):** Deterministic scripts for iteration/data. AI for interpretation/strategy only.
- **$200/month SKU minimum:** Below that consistently with no fix path = kill
- **ROAS breakeven: 3.0+ at 35-40% margins** — sales > spend is NOT enough
- **Halo effect matters:** Don't kill OG ads on multi-variation franchises without monitoring variation sales
- **#tasks is mandatory (Feb 8):** Every task posts to #tasks FIRST, before any work. No post = not done.
- **Numbers must match:** If agents disagree on a number, resolve it before reporting. Never make Marco choose.

## Ad Philosophy (Feb 10)

- Ads are a gas pedal, not an engine — page must convert first
- Old assumption "sales > spend = good" was wrong — need ROAS above breakeven
- Willing to accept small losses on halo-effect products (e.g. Jerome at -$28/mo)
- Prefers pausing and watching organic vs. gradual budget reduction
- Reviews: 3-day, 6-day, 9-day, 14-day cadence after changes

## Memory System Preferences (Feb 10)

- Wants memory system to grow continuously — "growing with me at all times"
- Demands checks and balances — automated monitoring, not self-reported "it's fine"
- Every health report must have numbers attached
- System should ensure he never has to repeat himself
- **AUTO-FIX APPLIES TO MEMORY (Feb 10):** If memory is broken, FIX IT IMMEDIATELY. Don't wait for Marco. Don't ask permission. Fix it, improve it, then report what you did. Memory must be working 100% of the time. No exceptions. This is the most important part of the entire ecosystem.
- **AUTO-FIX APPLIES TO MEMORY (Feb 10):** If memory is broken, fix it IMMEDIATELY. Don't wait for Marco. Don't ask. Fix it, improve it, then tell him what you did. This is the most important part of the entire system — it must be working 100% of the time. No exceptions.

### RULE it never happened in products that... (2026-02-11)
it never happened in products that conversation happened in finance so if we have done all of these memory updates that are in the system channel and you're talking about how I don't need anything else and you can build this in that and everything is built and you can search everything why when I go on a whole Nother channel you don't remember what we talked about. Why when I post a screenshot all of a sudden you remember it but then you make stuff up and say that conversation happened in products yesterday no it didn't. We didn't even have any conversations in products until I start testing here in products to to test the memory so now my questioning is, can you remember or not? Don't fill me up with BS what is the 6 o'clock memory health check about if you're not remembering what I ask you specifically to remember in the finance channel I asked for this stuff to be remembered you stated it will be remembered but nothing at all is being remembered. This is a total letdo? [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

I need you to know what needs to be ordered so would that being said I think we need to go to the dashboard channel and I need don't implement them but I need opus 4.5 to design a new dashboard.

OK, I also want you to do a monthly task for completing my Augusta Rule filings normally how I do it well first off last year after my account with information I got quotes from my belief for conference room facilities in the San Antonio area and this house. I got my number for the rental of my home 14 times per year and I have uploaded you the meeting template that I use one of the invoices and then some of the meeting notes from the meetings to see how we can get this done and I want this task. You can see it on the 25th of each month and normally what I do with that as far as the company that has the meeting is the company with the most revenue in the bank for the moth but here is some of the information that I said I would provide you so let's figure out how to handle this monthly. Also, I have been using invoice monster for the invoices up to this point. And then I also added the steps that I followed to complete this each month. Do I need to buy these files in the taxes channel instead?

Do you think we have enough to get that done and being notified in order so I could turn that notification on and I would probably say check these emails. I don't know.

### RULE just to make sure when you... (2026-02-11)
just to make sure when you maybe you should do chicks maybe hourly during the off hours times so it gives it less chance of missing orders and having to go back for to find orders because if it let's say Francis if the order comes in at 9:01 PM and it doesn't check again till 8 AM that is a lot of hours to wear I see possible mixup or mishaps with missing orders so is it possible to do the checks but maybe just mute the notifications in the orders until a certain time is that possible?

### RULE I'm not understanding why we keep... (2026-02-11)
I'm not understanding why we keep having these issues it's really getting to the point where I maybe I should shut this down but I have in your briefing at the top. You say zero new orders you say order tracker overnight runs eight runs completed zero new orders then in the very next section, you have Chris Smith arrive 2:50 AM via Etsy. I'm glad you called the order, but it should be no reason why it says zero new orders and the top section they should've just said maybe just order tracker ran eight runs completed and one order one new order captured. I'm so confused. The next thing is in the order section and the most recent orders section it is at 9 PM so we should run that more often because I don't have alerts on. I just need that order section to be up-to-date so as soon as I turn them on my computer if it's at 5 o'clock, I see that order and I can go in and place it. My next problem is and I need you to address every one of these github I have asked you about this so many times and don't hear that says no cron job configured I don't know why it's not. I've asked you about this probably at least 4 to 5 times cause I wanna make sure I'm getting backups of this system so I don't know why it is not configured because I've asked about it and you have confirmed it.

Don't hold nothing back again. Memory is the most important thing about this whole system. If it's not working, then I am wasting my time.
