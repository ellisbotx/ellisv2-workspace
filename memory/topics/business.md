## The Business

**Marco's Card Game Portfolio:**
- 3 brands: Black Owned, Card Plug, Kinfolk
- **Business addresses (all PO Boxes):**
  - Card Plug LLC — 9155 Schaefer Rd #1383, Converse TX 78109
  - Black Owned LLC — 9155 Schaefer Rd #1382, Converse TX 78109
  - Kinfolk LLC — 9155 Schaefer Rd #264, Converse TX 78109 (updated Feb 10, 2026; was #1381)
- ~160 SKUs, 20-30 meaningful revenue drivers
- Primary channel: Amazon FBA (3 separate Seller Central accounts)
- **2024 revenue: $1.3M+ | 2025 revenue: $800K+** (decline needs investigation)
- **Goal: $5M combined sales by end of 2028 (stretch: 2027)**
- Strategy: "Shots on goal" — launch more SKUs, let 80/20 rule identify winners
- Scalable catalog, automated ops, multi-million trajectory without Marco as bottleneck
- **Emoji: 💰** (changed from 🎴 on Feb 9)

**Healthy SKU Criteria:**
- $200+/month profit minimum
- ACOS under control
- 4.0+ review rating
- No "not what I expected" patterns
- Inventory turns without panic

**Kill SKU Rule:**
- Under $200/month profit consistently
- No clear fix path (listing/images/pricing)
- OR ad spend unscalable
- OR excessive returns
- OR storage liability

**Strategic Approach to $5M Goal (Feb 6, 2026):**
- Old method: simple average (total sales ÷ SKU count) × target = SKUs needed
- New method: account for 80/20 rule, model hit rate, strategic portfolio planning
- Philosophy: "Shots on goal" — more SKUs = more chances at winners
- Need to identify current top 20%, project trajectories, calculate new SKUs needed

## Portfolio Financial Snapshot (Feb 10, 2026)

**Trailing 12mo (Feb 2025 – Feb 2026):**
| Brand | Sales | Net Profit | Margin | Ad Spend | ACOS | Active SKUs | Dead SKUs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Black Owned | $407K | $109K | 26.7% | $70K | 17.2% | ~17 | ~18 |
| Card Plug | $299K | $120K | 40.0% | $10.8K | 3.6% | ~21 | ~24 (0 FBA stock) |
| Kinfolk | $275K | $80K | 29.1% | $46K | 16.8% | ~25 | ~20 |
| **TOTAL** | **$982K** | **$309K** | **31.4%** | **$127K** | — | **~63** | **~62** |

**Key Diagnoses (Mission 1 & 2):**
- Black Owned revenue collapsed 65% (Feb '25 $50.9K → Jan '26 $17.9K) — organic traffic died
- Card Plug is the template: best margins (40%), lowest ACOS (3.6%), zero dead inventory w/ FBA stock
- 38 SKUs flagged for kill (trapped inventory ~$14.8K COGS), 23 on 30-day watch (review Mar 10)
- Target: cut portfolio from ~125 → ~50 SKUs
- 36% of revenue comes from Nov+Dec — dangerous Q4 dependency
- Jan refund spike (16%+ all brands) = post-holiday gift returns
- Action items: cut BO ad spend 40%, file removal orders on dead stock, replicate Card Plug model

## Mission 3 Findings — Cash Fortress (Feb 10, 2026)

**SKU Classification (115 active SKUs analyzed):**
- 🟢 27 Stars ($200+/mo profit, healthy margins)
- 🟡 14 Watch ($100-200/mo, declining or high returns)
- 🔴 74 Kill (under $100/mo, no fix path)

**Cash Trapped in Dead/Excess Inventory: $35,197**
- Black Owned: $11,127 (18 zero-sale + 6 low-sellers = 24 kills)
- Card Plug: $18,500 (~25 dead SKUs — CP is NOT as clean as thought, massive AWD dead stock)
- Kinfolk: $5,570 (20 zero-sale + 5 low-sellers = 25 kills)

**Monthly Storage Drain: ~$597/mo ($7,164/yr)**
- BO: ~$252 (aged surcharges) | CP: ~$237 | KF: ~$108

**Critical Problem SKUs:**
- Sunday's Best (KF) — ACOS 109%, losing $312/mo. Kill ads immediately.
- Hood Hints OG (KF) — $1,092/mo ads for $699/mo profit. V2 makes more with $0 ads.
- HoodFued franchise (CP) — 22-31% return rates, 114 returns/30d = 69.5% of all CP returns
- SayLess OG (KF) — 24.7% return rate + $22.60/mo storage surcharge
- Girlll (BO) — 3,581 units = 9 years supply. Liquidate excess, keep listing.

**Top Performers to Double Down:**
- Baddie Drinking (BO) — $1,733/mo, $0 ads, 61% margin
- Soul Trivia (CP) — $1,086/mo, 16.6% conversion, 2% returns
- WSD R&B (KF) — $837/mo, $0 ads, 57% margin
- Hood Hints V2 (KF) — $720/mo, $0 ads, 60% margin
- ORALE Latino (CP) — $376/mo, new market expansion

**Cash Liberation Potential (UPDATED Feb 10 with actual COGS):**
- 62,739 units at $1.85/unit landed = $116,067 total cost basis
- Breakeven at ~6-7.5% Amazon liquidation recovery rate
- At 10% recovery → $143,651 = **$27,584 profit**
- At 7.5% recovery → ~$107,738 = **$8,329 loss**
- At 5% recovery → $71,825 = **$44,242 loss**
- Plus: stop storage bleed $597/mo ($7,164/yr)
- Key advantage: $1.85 landed cost caps downside — most brands can't liquidate profitably at any rate

**Kill List Cross-Reference (vs Marco's Feb 4 list of 64):**
- 42 overlap (confirmed), 32 NEW kills Marco needs to add (~$8,254 additional)
- 4 reconsider candidates: Bad and Boujee, Stay Woke, Girlll (partial), Grown Folks
- Total liquidation universe: ~96 unique SKUs
- Reports: `/workspace/data/mission_3_cash_fortress.md`, `/workspace/data/reports/kill_list_crossref_v2.md`

**Portfolio Grade: C+ (projected B+ after cleanup)**

## Ad Strategy Overhaul (Feb 10, 2026)

**Marco's old assumption:** Sales > Spend = good. **Reality:** Need 3.0+ ROAS at ~35-40% margins to break even.

**Kinfolk:** All ads paused. Running organic-only experiment.
**Black Owned:** Killed 3 campaigns (Prayer Warrior Perf, Ghetto Pass, Black Love). Cut Hood Charades budget $500→$200/day (7 variations, too important to kill). Kept Jerome ($28/mo loss, 1 variation) and Prayer Warrior Product Target (3.27 ROAS).
**Estimated savings: ~$9,200/mo**

**Halo Effect Principle:** OG product ads may drive variation sales. Can't kill ads on multi-variation franchises without risking the whole family. Test by monitoring variation sales after pausing OG ads.

**Review date: Feb 24** — compare organic hold across all changes.
**Reference: `/workspace/data/ad_changes_feb10.md`**

## Current Priority

**Etsy → MCF Automation (Card Plug):**
- All credentials collected and stored
- Need to build the actual Python script
- Will replicate for Black Owned and Kinfolk after Card Plug works

**Trifecta Dashboard:**
- Located at `/workspace/trifecta/index.html`
- Auto-updates after each ASIN check
- Shows all 3 brands, suppression status, last check time
- Products page now uses real Sellerboard velocity data (90-day sales)

**Sellerboard Velocity Integration (Completed Feb 2, 2026):**
- All 3 brands exported and CORRECTED: Black Owned ($134.5K revenue, 5,763 units), Card Plug ($151.3K, 7,954 units), Kinfolk ($118.5K, 5,983 units)
- Total: 170 SKUs, 19,700 units sold in 90 days, $404,365 revenue (Nov 4, 2025 → Feb 2, 2026, Amazon.com US only)
- Data source: "Dashboard by product" CSV exports from Sellerboard
- Processing script: `/workspace/scripts/sellerboard_export.py` (fixed to avoid double-counting ad sales and filter by date/marketplace)
- Output: `/workspace/data/sku_velocity.json`
- Reorder tracker and Products dashboard now use real velocity instead of estimates
- Initial error: Reported $897K (3x overcount due to triple-counting ad sales + wrong date range + multiple marketplaces)

OK now here's a screenshot of the exact conversation that we had hours ago. This is the type of issue that if you're gonna take care of my task, you need to take care of my task now here and right now we need to figure out what needs to be done. How do we handle it? If I tell you something has been done in another channel I shouldn't have to tell you again in this channel. I remember when I ask you specifically do I have to ask you in any channel or tell you in this channel to remove a task and you said no you will remember it. This is unacceptable right this minute. Let's come up with a plan or figure out a better way cause other than that I might as well utilize Google task or Todoist to handle these type of things if you cannot.

amount I think before we get this worked out I will check the amount for the amount from last year, but I will verify them with the majority of them will stay the same. Are there now what I did I can't remember I could have worked out with that amount like Francis just taking this one to account at 292.54 that was taken out of all three of my business bank accounts so whatever the total amount was was the amount and then it was divided amongst all three businesses is that sound like the correct way to do it?

I have it I am it is not 220,000 in r from the 65 skews is no way on earth that any of you all looked at those 60 bucks pull the numbers for 90 days and seen that they were generating 220,000 in revenue because if they were, I would not be liquidating them tell me whether it makes sense cause if I'm generating 220,000 revenue I could pay the 21,000 a month this is making zero sense [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

### COMMITMENT What happens if I don’t take... (2026-02-12)
What happens if I don’t take the requested action? If you do not update your credentials before 2026-08-11T15:35:23.917Z, your application will be blocked from making calls to the Amazon Services API. This may directly impact your business and any customers that previously authorized your application. Loss of access may restrict critical business functions including orders, ship confirmations, shipping labels, and invoices. If your application is blocked due to failure to rotate LWA credentials by the deadline, initiating LWA credential rotation will result in your application becoming unblocked automatically. You will still need to begin using the new credentials as the old secret expires after seven days. Can my LWA credentials be rotated programmatically? Yes. We have launched the Application Management API, which allows you to programmatically rotate the client secret on registered applications. More information on the Application Management API: https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/application-management-api-v2023-11-30-use-case-guide#tutorial-rotate-your-applications-client-secret [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
