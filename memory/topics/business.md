## The Business

**Marco's Card Game Portfolio:**
- 3 brands: Black Owned, Card Plug, Kinfolk
- **Business addresses (all PO Boxes):**
  - Card Plug LLC — 9155 Schaefer Rd #1383, Converse TX 78109
  - Black Owned LLC — 9155 Schaefer Rd #1382, Converse TX 78109
  - Kinfolk LLC — 9155 Schaefer Rd #264, Converse TX 78109 (updated Feb 10, 2026; was #1381)
- ~160 SKUs, 20-30 meaningful revenue drivers
- Primary channel: Amazon FBA (3 separate Seller Central accounts)
- **2024 revenue: $1.3M+ | 2025 revenue: $800K+** (decline needs investigation)
- **Goal: $5M combined sales by end of 2028 (stretch: 2027)**
- Strategy: "Shots on goal" — launch more SKUs, let 80/20 rule identify winners
- Scalable catalog, automated ops, multi-million trajectory without Marco as bottleneck
- **Emoji: 💰** (changed from 🎴 on Feb 9)

**Healthy SKU Criteria:**
- $200+/month profit minimum
- ACOS under control
- 4.0+ review rating
- No "not what I expected" patterns
- Inventory turns without panic

**Kill SKU Rule:**
- Under $200/month profit consistently
- No clear fix path (listing/images/pricing)
- OR ad spend unscalable
- OR excessive returns
- OR storage liability

**Strategic Approach to $5M Goal (Feb 6, 2026):**
- Old method: simple average (total sales ÷ SKU count) × target = SKUs needed
- New method: account for 80/20 rule, model hit rate, strategic portfolio planning
- Philosophy: "Shots on goal" — more SKUs = more chances at winners
- Need to identify current top 20%, project trajectories, calculate new SKUs needed

## Portfolio Financial Snapshot (Feb 10, 2026)

**Trailing 12mo (Feb 2025 – Feb 2026):**
| Brand | Sales | Net Profit | Margin | Ad Spend | ACOS | Active SKUs | Dead SKUs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Black Owned | $407K | $109K | 26.7% | $70K | 17.2% | ~17 | ~18 |
| Card Plug | $299K | $120K | 40.0% | $10.8K | 3.6% | ~21 | ~24 (0 FBA stock) |
| Kinfolk | $275K | $80K | 29.1% | $46K | 16.8% | ~25 | ~20 |
| **TOTAL** | **$982K** | **$309K** | **31.4%** | **$127K** | — | **~63** | **~62** |

**Key Diagnoses (Mission 1 & 2):**
- Black Owned revenue collapsed 65% (Feb '25 $50.9K → Jan '26 $17.9K) — organic traffic died
- Card Plug is the template: best margins (40%), lowest ACOS (3.6%), zero dead inventory w/ FBA stock
- 38 SKUs flagged for kill (trapped inventory ~$14.8K COGS), 23 on 30-day watch (review Mar 10)
- Target: cut portfolio from ~125 → ~50 SKUs
- 36% of revenue comes from Nov+Dec — dangerous Q4 dependency
- Jan refund spike (16%+ all brands) = post-holiday gift returns
- Action items: cut BO ad spend 40%, file removal orders on dead stock, replicate Card Plug model

## Mission 3 Findings — Cash Fortress (Feb 10, 2026)

**SKU Classification (115 active SKUs analyzed):**
- 🟢 27 Stars ($200+/mo profit, healthy margins)
- 🟡 14 Watch ($100-200/mo, declining or high returns)
- 🔴 74 Kill (under $100/mo, no fix path)

**Cash Trapped in Dead/Excess Inventory: $35,197**
- Black Owned: $11,127 (18 zero-sale + 6 low-sellers = 24 kills)
- Card Plug: $18,500 (~25 dead SKUs — CP is NOT as clean as thought, massive AWD dead stock)
- Kinfolk: $5,570 (20 zero-sale + 5 low-sellers = 25 kills)

**Monthly Storage Drain: ~$597/mo ($7,164/yr)**
- BO: ~$252 (aged surcharges) | CP: ~$237 | KF: ~$108

**Critical Problem SKUs:**
- Sunday's Best (KF) — ACOS 109%, losing $312/mo. Kill ads immediately.
- Hood Hints OG (KF) — $1,092/mo ads for $699/mo profit. V2 makes more with $0 ads.
- HoodFued franchise (CP) — 22-31% return rates, 114 returns/30d = 69.5% of all CP returns
- SayLess OG (KF) — 24.7% return rate + $22.60/mo storage surcharge
- Girlll (BO) — 3,581 units = 9 years supply. Liquidate excess, keep listing.

**Top Performers to Double Down:**
- Baddie Drinking (BO) — $1,733/mo, $0 ads, 61% margin
- Soul Trivia (CP) — $1,086/mo, 16.6% conversion, 2% returns
- WSD R&B (KF) — $837/mo, $0 ads, 57% margin
- Hood Hints V2 (KF) — $720/mo, $0 ads, 60% margin
- ORALE Latino (CP) — $376/mo, new market expansion

**Cash Liberation Potential:**
- Liquidate 74 kill SKUs: $10,500-17,600 recovery
- Liquidate excess from selling SKUs: $8,000-13,500
- Stop aged surcharges: $362/mo saved
- Total: $18,500-31,100 one-time + $4,344/yr ongoing

**Kill List Cross-Reference (vs Marco's Feb 4 list of 64):**
- 42 overlap (confirmed), 32 NEW kills Marco needs to add (~$8,254 additional)
- 4 reconsider candidates: Bad and Boujee, Stay Woke, Girlll (partial), Grown Folks
- Total liquidation universe: ~96 unique SKUs
- Reports: `/workspace/data/mission_3_cash_fortress.md`, `/workspace/data/reports/kill_list_crossref_v2.md`

**Portfolio Grade: C+ (projected B+ after cleanup)**

## Ad Strategy Overhaul (Feb 10, 2026)

**Marco's old assumption:** Sales > Spend = good. **Reality:** Need 3.0+ ROAS at ~35-40% margins to break even.

**Kinfolk:** All ads paused. Running organic-only experiment.
**Black Owned:** Killed 3 campaigns (Prayer Warrior Perf, Ghetto Pass, Black Love). Cut Hood Charades budget $500→$200/day (7 variations, too important to kill). Kept Jerome ($28/mo loss, 1 variation) and Prayer Warrior Product Target (3.27 ROAS).
**Estimated savings: ~$9,200/mo**

**Halo Effect Principle:** OG product ads may drive variation sales. Can't kill ads on multi-variation franchises without risking the whole family. Test by monitoring variation sales after pausing OG ads.

**Review date: Feb 24** — compare organic hold across all changes.

## Current Priority

**Etsy → MCF Automation (Card Plug):**
- All credentials collected and stored
- Need to build the actual Python script
- Will replicate for Black Owned and Kinfolk after Card Plug works

**Trifecta Dashboard:**
- Located at `/workspace/trifecta/index.html`
- Auto-updates after each ASIN check
- Shows all 3 brands, suppression status, last check time
- Products page now uses real Sellerboard velocity data (90-day sales)

**Sellerboard Velocity Integration (Completed Feb 2, 2026):**
- All 3 brands exported and CORRECTED: Black Owned ($134.5K revenue, 5,763 units), Card Plug ($151.3K, 7,954 units), Kinfolk ($118.5K, 5,983 units)
- Total: 170 SKUs, 19,700 units sold in 90 days, $404,365 revenue (Nov 4, 2025 → Feb 2, 2026, Amazon.com US only)
- Data source: "Dashboard by product" CSV exports from Sellerboard
- Processing script: `/workspace/scripts/sellerboard_export.py` (fixed to avoid double-counting ad sales and filter by date/marketplace)
- Output: `/workspace/data/sku_velocity.json`
- Reorder tracker and Products dashboard now use real velocity instead of estimates
- Initial error: Reported $897K (3x overcount due to triple-counting ad sales + wrong date range + multiple marketplaces)
