# Daily Log — 2026-02-13

- Marco feedback in #tasks: expected report outputs to match the task-board-style format ("I thought all the reports would look like this"). Action taken: added report-standardization task and reposted updated task board.
- Correction from Marco with screenshot proof: pinning was previously disabled ("we no longer need to pin anything to the top"). Action taken: unpinned the newly pinned board and logged the no-pinning preference in tracker.


- **[RULE]** how's the memory going on our system? Is it working out? Do we need to fix anything change anything? Is there any way to expand it to make sure you're learning more and more and I don't have to say things over again. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** you know how to fix this you should be able to make this the best memory system ever in the history of open claw now tell me what your plan is to fix this. Make sure it's not gonna break anything and tell me who's gonna be responsible in which llm will be making sure it's running properly [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** is there anything else that needs to be done looking for the full fix? I've asked before and you said oh it's perfect. It's running great no problems and now you're saying that there are problems now. Do we have any checks and balances in place to always be looking for ways to make sure the memory is running a tiptop shape, growing, expanding and easy to utilize for the agents [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** so what is our check and improvement plan for memory? I need this system to be growing with me at all times give me a detailed plan on how you're gonna ensure that you are learning you are growing and you have access to searchable memory did you and this is very important take a look at before even responding to me to make sure you have full context understanding and everything you need to help me.

- **[RULE]** so I'm gonna ask you again everything is fully operational with the memory. It is working at tiptop shape. That's question number one then number two. What is the plan going forward to always daily maybe even two times a day be checking to make sure everything and memory is working flawlessly. It is the most important part of this whole ecosystem and someone needs to be working on it. Continuously are watching it continuously. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** now also, I've said this before, but I'm gonna say it again because I don't even know if the memories been working with this being the most important part of this whole entire system if it is not working and it's something I've asked you to make sure it's working then fix it immediately. Don't wait for me to tell you to fix something that I want to be working. Get it fixed if it's something that will make it better then make it better. Don't wait for me now once you do these things I want to know, but it 100% needs to be working 100% of the time. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

- **[RULE]** I want you to take a look at this github this is supposed to be something to improve the memory. I want you to be very transparent analyze it thoroughly no rush and tell me will this help our memory again I continue to tell you memory is the most important part of this whole system so with this help it at all if so, is this something we should add or can you build this exact model out yourself before you do anything, give me a nice detailed brief of each option https://github.com/momo-personal-assistant/openclaw-plugin [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** if option B is gonna make it better and you're gonna continue memory health checks and have a backup for a backup to make sure everything is running as I've told you before if you know how to make it better don't ask me just make it better [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

- **[RULE]** OK, so Ellis this was before we switched your llm I want you to look at the screenshot and tell me what is wrong with the previous Ellis behavior. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** OK, so I want you to go through and do a full check on first and foremost the memory of this system I want you to tell me if it's running correctly if there are any updates that need to be done how efficient should it be because I don't know if it's the open claw system or the LLM that I was utilizing that was causing this type of behavior and I want you to take a look at the memory and then we will go from there to See what we need to do know what you need to do to fix this behavior and everything else we got going on give me a full detail [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** your directive is number one first and foremost, memory, memory context, searching of memory. That is the most important thing of this whole open claw system if it doesn't work. Then this is a complete waste of my time so if you know a way to make things better make them work more efficiently, and to help us grow as a company and for you to grow as in as a employee of this company as the person running it as the brain is behind it I want you to automatically do it. Don't ask me just tell me what you have done after it was done here in the systems channel and tell me why it was done that's it so from here on please remember that and get it done so fix those four things and then I'm going to ask you some more questions to find tune in this memory.

- **[RULE]** now just recap what is gonna be done continuously checks that the checks and balances for the memory to make sure it is working at tiptop shape layout your detailed plan on how to continuously do that as well as continuously improve it. Please earn your keep as the top LLM and help open claw be better. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[RULE]** so do you feel confident as the new Ellis that this plan will help us to be the very best that we can be I want you to stamp your name on it and if you don't believe so say no. I have put below some alternatives or some add-ons that others have built for open claw and say that they help the memory better. I want you to analyze these see if it's better be very objective for me to just pay for one of these or add on one of these or if you can build this yourself and it run the same if not better or let me know if what you've already done is better or comparable to these please give me a full breakdown. Don't hold nothing back again. Memory is the most important thing about this whole system. If it's not working, then I am wasting my time. Your job is to tell me what I need to do so I am not wasting my time. https://supermemory.ai/docs/intro and https://github.com/clawdbrunner/openclaw-graphiti-memory [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

- **[RULE]** is self reflection that you're talking about the same as this skill here now I don't want to apply the skill.

- **[RULE]** no give this to a opus 4.6 sub agent because you haven't been able to do it now what is it that needs to be done? I don't even know what's going on. We need to get this done and get it done now. You have never taken this long to accomplish anything. [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
- **[COMMITMENT]** so on that stuff that has deadlines like say for instance the tax the tax filed by is does it have some type of notification and then you have the monthly accountable plan reimbursement that's not on reoccurring that you're being in a reoccurring section also, I don't see the Augustus, which should be in the reoccurring also [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]

- **[RULE]** today we had a real problem when you were having issues with whatever you were trying to do what to do is and it took hours upon hours over three hours for me to finally tell you to give it to a sub agent from a different LLM for them to give it a try. What can we implement that is a check in balance where this will never ever happen again and I will not waste that much time now again if it takes time, I deeply understand but when you transferred the job over to a sub agent, they got it done within 10 minutes so it tells me it 100% did not have to take three hours or longe so before you implement anything, let's talk through this [from: LewisG (1467288867697590426)]
